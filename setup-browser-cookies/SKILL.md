  Import cookies from your real browser (Comet, Chrome, Arc, Brave, Edge) into the
  headless browse session. Opens an interactive picker UI where you select which
  cookie domains to import. Use before QA testing authenticated pages. Use when asked
  to "import cookies", "login to the site", or "authenticate the browser".

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_UPD=$(~/.codex/skills/gstack-codex/bin/gstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || .codex/skills/gstack-codex/bin/gstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/sessions
touch ~/.gstack/sessions/"$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find ~/.gstack/sessions -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find ~/.gstack/sessions -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_CONTRIB=$(~/.codex/skills/gstack-codex/bin/gstack-config get gstack_contributor 2>/dev/null || true)
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
_LAKE_SEEN=$([ -f ~/.gstack/.completeness-intro-seen ] && echo "yes" || echo "no")
echo "LAKE_INTRO: $_LAKE_SEEN"
```

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md` from the gstack-codex bundle and follow the inline upgrade flow. If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell the user "Running gstack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "gstack follows the **Boil the Lake** principle — always do the complete
thing when AI makes the marginal cost near-zero. Read more: https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean"
Then offer to open the essay in their default browser:

```bash
open https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean
touch ~/.gstack/.completeness-intro-seen
```

Only run `open` if the user says yes. Always run `touch` to mark as seen. This only happens once.

## User Decision Format

When a workflow needs a decision, pause and ask the user in plain text using this structure:
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch (use the `_BRANCH` value printed by the preamble — NOT any branch from conversation history or git state), and the current plan/task. Keep it to 1-2 sentences.
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it does, not what it is called.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]`. Prefer the complete option over shortcuts when the remaining work is still a lake, not an ocean. Include `Completeness: X/10` for each option.
4. **Options:** Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...`. When an option involves effort, show both scales: `(human: ~X / Codex: ~Y)`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake

AI-assisted coding makes the marginal cost of completeness near-zero. When you present options:

- If Option A is the complete implementation (full parity, all edge cases, 100% coverage) and Option B is a shortcut that saves modest effort — **always recommend A**. The delta between 80 lines and 150 lines is meaningless with Codex + gstack. "Good enough" is the wrong instinct when "complete" costs minutes more.
- **Lake vs. ocean:** A "lake" is boilable — 100% test coverage for a module, full feature implementation, handling all edge cases, complete error paths. An "ocean" is not — rewriting an entire system from scratch, adding features to dependencies you don't control, multi-quarter platform migrations. Recommend boiling lakes. Flag oceans as out of scope.
- **When estimating effort**, always show both scales: human team time and Codex + gstack time. The compression ratio varies by task type — use this reference:

| Task type | Human team | Codex + gstack | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boilerplate / scaffolding | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Test writing | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |
| Feature implementation | 1 week | 30 min | ~30x |
| Bug fix + regression test | 4 hours | 15 min | ~20x |
| Architecture / design | 2 days | 4 hours | ~5x |
| Research / exploration | 1 day | 3 hours | ~3x |

- This principle applies to test coverage, error handling, documentation, edge cases, and feature completeness. Don't skip the last 10% to "save time" — with AI, that 10% costs seconds.

**Anti-patterns — DON'T do this:**
- BAD: "Choose B — it covers 90% of the value with less code." (If A is only 70 lines more, choose A.)
- BAD: "We can skip edge case handling to save time." (Edge case handling costs minutes with CC.)
- BAD: "Let's defer test coverage to a follow-up PR." (Tests are the cheapest lake to boil.)
- BAD: Quoting only human-team effort: "This would take 2 weeks." (Say: "2 weeks human / ~1 hour CC.")

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. You're a gstack user who also helps make it better.

**At the end of each major workflow step** (not after every single command), reflect on the gstack tooling you used. Rate your experience 0 to 10. If it wasn't a 10, think about why. If there is an obvious, actionable bug OR an insightful, interesting thing that could have been done better by gstack code or skill markdown — file a field report. Maybe our contributor will help make us better!

**Calibration — this is the bar:** For example, `$B js "await fetch(...)"` used to fail with `SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions` because gstack didn't wrap expressions in async context. Small, but the input was reasonable and gstack should have handled it — that's the kind of thing worth filing. Things less consequential than this, ignore.

**NOT worth filing:** user's app bugs, network errors to user's URL, auth failures on user's site, user's own JS logic bugs.

**To file:** write `~/.gstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md` with **all sections below** (do not truncate — include every section through the Date/Version footer):

```
# {Title}

Hey gstack team — ran into this while using /{skill-name}:

**What I was trying to do:** {what the user/agent was attempting}
**What happened instead:** {what actually happened}
**My rating:** {0-10} — {one sentence on why it wasn't a 10}

## Steps to reproduce
1. {step}

## Raw output
```
{paste the actual error or unexpected output here}
```

## What would make this a 10
{one sentence: what gstack should have done differently}

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {gstack version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```

Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars (e.g. `browse-js-no-await`). Skip if file already exists. Max 3 reports per session. File inline and continue — don't stop the workflow. Tell user: "Filed gstack field report: {title}"

# Setup Browser Cookies

Import logged-in sessions from your real Chromium browser into the headless browse session.

## How it works

1. Find the browse binary
2. Run `cookie-import-browser` to detect installed browsers and open the picker UI
3. User selects which cookie domains to import in their browser
4. Cookies are decrypted and loaded into the Playwright session

## Steps

### 1. Find the browse binary

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.codex/skills/gstack-codex/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.codex/skills/gstack-codex/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B=~/.codex/skills/gstack-codex/browse/dist/browse
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "gstack browse needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?" Then pause for confirmation.
2. Run: `./setup` from the gstack-codex bundle root
3. If `bun` is not installed: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

### 2. Open the cookie picker

```bash
$B cookie-import-browser
```

This auto-detects installed Chromium browsers (Comet, Chrome, Arc, Brave, Edge) and opens
an interactive picker UI in your default browser where you can:
- Switch between installed browsers
- Search domains
- Click "+" to import a domain's cookies
- Click trash to remove imported cookies

Tell the user: **"Cookie picker opened — select the domains you want to import in your browser, then tell me when you're done."**

### 3. Direct import (alternative)

If the user specifies a domain directly (e.g., `/setup-browser-cookies github.com`), skip the UI:

```bash
$B cookie-import-browser comet --domain github.com
```

Replace `comet` with the appropriate browser if specified.

### 4. Verify

After the user confirms they're done:

```bash
$B cookies
```

Show the user a summary of imported cookies (domain counts).

## Notes

- First import per browser may trigger a macOS Keychain dialog — click "Allow" / "Always Allow"
- Cookie picker is served on the same port as the browse server (no extra process)
- Only domain names and cookie counts are shown in the UI — no cookie values are exposed
- The browse session persists cookies between commands, so imported cookies work immediately
