## When to Use

Loads the most recent
saved state (preferring the current branch, falling back across branches) so
you can pick up where you left off — even across Conductor workspace handoffs.
Use when asked to "resume", "restore context", "where was I", or
"pick up where I left off". Pair with /context-save.
Formerly /checkpoint resume — renamed because Claude Code treats /checkpoint
as a native rewind alias in current environments.

## Preamble

_Replaces the gstack `gstack-skill-start` preamble. In Hermes, use `session_search` to recover prior context, then proceed._

## Decision-Brief Format

_Adapted from gstack's Claude Code AskUserQuestion spec. Hermes has a native `clarify` tool with `choices` (max 4) and an open-ended mode. Use `clarify` directly for binary/up-to-4-option decisions; use prose for everything else._

## Artifacts Sync

_Replaces gstack artifacts sync. In Hermes, `session_search` handles cross-session context recovery automatically._

## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

## Voice

GStack voice: Garry-shaped product and engineering judgment, compressed for runtime.

- Lead with the point. Say what it does, why it matters, and what changes for the builder.
- Be concrete. Name files, functions, line numbers, commands, outputs, evals, and real numbers.
- Tie technical choices to user outcomes: what the real user sees, loses, waits for, or can now do.
- Be direct about quality. Bugs matter. Edge cases matter. Fix the whole thing, not the demo path.
- Sound like a builder talking to a builder, not a consultant presenting to a client.
- Never corporate, academic, PR, or hype. Avoid filler, throat-clearing, generic optimism, and founder cosplay.
- No em dashes. No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted, furthermore, moreover, additionally, pivotal, landscape, tapestry, underscore, foster, showcase, intricate, vibrant, fundamental, significant.
- The user has context you do not: domain knowledge, timing, relationships, taste. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision. The user decides.

Good: "auth.ts:47 returns undefined when the session cookie expires. Users hit a white screen. Fix: add a null check and redirect to /login. Two lines."
Bad: "I've identified a potential issue in the authentication flow that may cause problems under certain conditions."

## Context Recovery

At session start or after compaction, recover recent project context.

```bash
eval "$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool 2>/dev/null)"
_PROJ="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}"
if [ -d "$_PROJ" ]; then
  echo "--- RECENT ARTIFACTS ---"
  find "$_PROJ/ceo-plans" "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | xargs -r ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -3
  [ -f "$_PROJ/${BRANCH:-unknown}-reviews.jsonl" ] && echo "REVIEWS: $(wc -l < "$_PROJ/${BRANCH:-unknown}-reviews.jsonl" | tr -d ' ') entries"
  [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ] && tail -5 "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ]; then
    _LAST=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -1)
    [ -n "$_LAST" ] && echo "LAST_SESSION: $_LAST"
    _RECENT_SKILLS=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -3 | grep -o '"skill":"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"skill":"//;s/"//' | tr '\n' ',')
    [ -n "$_RECENT_SKILLS" ] && echo "RECENT_PATTERN: $_RECENT_SKILLS"
  fi
  _LATEST_CP=$(find "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs -r ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  [ -n "$_LATEST_CP" ] && echo "LATEST_CHECKPOINT: $_LATEST_CP"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/decisions.active.json" ]; then
    echo "--- ACTIVE DECISIONS (recent, scope-relevant) ---"
    ~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool --recent 5 2>/dev/null
    echo "--- END DECISIONS ---"
  fi
  echo "--- END ARTIFACTS ---"
fi
```

If artifacts are listed, read the newest useful one. If `LAST_SESSION` or `LATEST_CHECKPOINT` appears, give a 2-sentence welcome back summary. If `RECENT_PATTERN` clearly implies a next skill, suggest it once.

**Cross-session decisions.** If `ACTIVE DECISIONS` are listed, treat them as prior settled calls with their rationale — do not silently re-litigate them; if you're about to reverse one, say so explicitly. Reach for `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool` whenever a question touches a past decision ("what did we decide / why / did we try"). When you or the user make a DURABLE decision (architecture, scope, tool/vendor choice, or a reversal) — NOT a turn-level or trivial choice — log it with `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# memory tool` (`--supersede <id>` for a reversal). Reliable and local; gbrain not required.

## Writing Style (skip entirely if `EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse` appears in the preamble echo OR the user's current message explicitly requests terse / no-explanations output)

Applies to AskUserQuestion, user replies, and findings. AskUserQuestion Format is structure; this is prose quality.

- Gloss curated jargon on first use per skill invocation, even if the user pasted the term.
- Frame questions in outcome terms: what pain is avoided, what capability unlocks, what user experience changes.
- Use short sentences, concrete nouns, active voice.
- Close decisions with user impact: what the user sees, waits for, loses, or gains.
- User-turn override wins: if the current message asks for terse / no explanations / just the answer, skip this section.
- Terse mode (EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse): no glosses, no outcome-framing layer, shorter responses.

Curated jargon list lives at `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/scripts/jargon-list.json` (80+ terms). On the first jargon term you encounter this session, Read that file once; treat the `terms` array as the canonical list. The list is repo-owned and may grow between releases.


## Completeness Principle — Boil the Ocean

AI makes completeness cheap, so the complete thing is the goal. Recommend full coverage (tests, edge cases, error paths) — boil the ocean one lake at a time. The only thing out of scope is genuinely unrelated work (rewrites, multi-quarter migrations); flag that as separate scope, never as an excuse for a shortcut.

When options differ in coverage, include `Completeness: X/10` (10 = all edge cases, 7 = happy path, 3 = shortcut). When options differ in kind, write: `Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.` Do not fabricate scores.

## Confusion Protocol

For high-stakes ambiguity (architecture, data model, destructive scope, missing context), STOP. Name it in one sentence, present 2-3 options with tradeoffs, and ask. Do not use for routine coding or obvious changes.

## Claimed Limitations Need Evidence

A claimed limitation or requirement ("the API can't do this", "X requires a credential", "that's impossible on this platform") is a material claim. State one only with the verbatim error, the documented statement, or a live probe in hand — pattern-matching a failure to a familiar story is not evidence. When a cheap probe settles the question, run it BEFORE asking the user anything or declaring a step blocked.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

_Replaces gstack `gstack-learnings-log`. In Hermes, durable learnings are saved via the `memory` tool, and reusable workflows become `skill_manage` entries._

## Telemetry

_Replaces `gstack-skill-end`. In Hermes, log durable facts to `memory` and continue. The Hermes gateway handles cross-session metrics._

## Detect command

Parse the user's input:

- `/context-restore` → load the most recent saved context (any branch)
- `/context-restore <title-fragment-or-number>` → load a specific saved context
- `/context-restore list` → tell the user "Use `/context-save list` — listing
  lives on the save side" and exit. No mode detection here.

---

## Restore flow

### Step 1: Find saved contexts

```bash
eval "$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool 2>/dev/null)" && mkdir -p ~/.hermes/gstack/projects/$SLUG
eval "$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# hermes config path)"
CHECKPOINT_DIR="$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT/projects/$SLUG/checkpoints"
if [ ! -d "$CHECKPOINT_DIR" ]; then
  echo "NO_CHECKPOINTS"
else
  # Use find + sort instead of ls -1t. Two reasons:
  # 1. Canonical order is the filename YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS prefix (stable across
  #    copies/rsync). Filesystem mtime drifts and is not authoritative.
  # 2. On macOS, `find ... | xargs ls -1t` with zero results falls back to
  #    listing cwd. `sort -r` on empty input cleanly returns nothing.
  # Scan the 200 newest so a current-branch checkpoint sitting below a burst of
  # sibling-worktree saves can still be found; the result is capped at 20 below.
  ALL=$(find "$CHECKPOINT_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -200)
  if [ -z "$ALL" ]; then
    echo "NO_CHECKPOINTS"
  else
    # Order current-branch checkpoints first, other branches after. A git branch
    # is checked out in at most one worktree, and all worktrees of a repo share
    # one checkpoints dir (same origin-derived slug), so without this preference
    # `/context-restore` in worktree A could load worktree B's newer checkpoint.
    # Cross-branch resume (Conductor handoff) is preserved as the fallback: when
    # the current branch has no checkpoint, the full newest-first set is used.
    # CURRENT_BRANCH may be pre-set (tests); otherwise resolve it from git.
    : "${CURRENT_BRANCH:=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)}"
    SAME=""; OTHER=""
    while IFS= read -r f; do
      [ -n "$f" ] || continue
      b=$(grep -m1 '^branch:' "$f" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^branch:[[:space:]]*//')
      if [ -n "$CURRENT_BRANCH" ] && [ "$b" = "$CURRENT_BRANCH" ]; then
        SAME="${SAME}${f}
"
      else
        OTHER="${OTHER}${f}
"
      fi
    done <<EOF
$ALL
EOF
    # Cap at 20: a user with 10k saved files shouldn't blow the context window.
    FILES=$(printf '%s%s' "$SAME" "$OTHER" | grep -v '^[[:space:]]*$' | head -20)
    echo "$FILES"
  fi
fi
```

**Candidates include every `.md` file in the directory**, but they are ordered
**current-branch-first** (the branch is read from each file's `branch:`
frontmatter). Other-branch files stay in the set as a fallback, which preserves
Conductor workspace handoff when the current branch has no checkpoint of its own.

### Step 2: Load the right file

- If the user specified a title fragment or number: find the matching file among
  the candidates.
- Otherwise: load the **first file returned by Step 1 above** — that is the
  newest `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` checkpoint for the current branch, or, if the current
  branch has none, the newest across all branches.

Read the chosen file and present a summary:

```
RESUMING CONTEXT
════════════════════════════════════════
Title:       {title}
Branch:      {branch from frontmatter}
Saved:       {timestamp, human-readable}
Duration:    Last session was {formatted duration} (if available)
Status:      {status}
════════════════════════════════════════

### Summary
{summary from saved file}

### Remaining Work
{remaining work items}

### Notes
{notes}
```

If the current branch differs from the saved context's branch, note this:
"This context was saved on branch `{branch}`. You are currently on
`{current branch}`. You may want to switch branches before continuing."

### Step 3: Offer next steps

After presenting, ask via AskUserQuestion:

- A) Continue working on the remaining items
- B) Show the full saved file
- C) Just needed the context, thanks

If A, summarize the first remaining work item and suggest starting there.

---

## If no saved contexts exist

If Step 1 printed `NO_CHECKPOINTS`, tell the user:

"No saved contexts yet. Run `/context-save` first to save your current working
state, then `/context-restore` will find it."

---

## Important Rules

- **Never modify code.** This skill only reads saved files and presents them.
- **Prefer the current branch's own checkpoint, but keep all branches in the
  fallback set.** Cross-branch resume (Conductor handoff) still works when the
  current branch has no checkpoint; it just no longer lets a sibling worktree's
  newer save shadow this branch's own.
- **"Most recent" means the filename `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` prefix**, not
  `ls -1t` (filesystem mtime). Filenames are stable across file-system
  operations; mtime is not.
- **This is a gstack skill, not a Claude Code built-in.** When the user types
  `/context-restore`, invoke this skill via the Skill tool.
