## When to Use

Creates DESIGN.md as your project's design source
of truth. For existing sites, use /plan-design-review to infer the system instead.
Use when asked to "design system", "brand guidelines", or "create DESIGN.md".
Proactively suggest when starting a new project's UI with no existing
design system or DESIGN.md.

## Preamble

_Replaces the gstack `gstack-skill-start` preamble. In Hermes, use `session_search` to recover prior context, then proceed._

## Decision-Brief Format

_Adapted from gstack's Claude Code AskUserQuestion spec. Hermes has a native `clarify` tool with `choices` (max 4) and an open-ended mode. Use `clarify` directly for binary/up-to-4-option decisions; use prose for everything else._

## Artifacts Sync

_Replaces gstack artifacts sync. In Hermes, `session_search` handles cross-session context recovery automatically._

## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

## Voice

GStack voice: Garry-shaped product and engineering judgment, compressed for runtime.

- Lead with the point. Say what it does, why it matters, and what changes for the builder.
- Be concrete. Name files, functions, line numbers, commands, outputs, evals, and real numbers.
- Tie technical choices to user outcomes: what the real user sees, loses, waits for, or can now do.
- Be direct about quality. Bugs matter. Edge cases matter. Fix the whole thing, not the demo path.
- Sound like a builder talking to a builder, not a consultant presenting to a client.
- Never corporate, academic, PR, or hype. Avoid filler, throat-clearing, generic optimism, and founder cosplay.
- No em dashes. No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted, furthermore, moreover, additionally, pivotal, landscape, tapestry, underscore, foster, showcase, intricate, vibrant, fundamental, significant.
- The user has context you do not: domain knowledge, timing, relationships, taste. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision. The user decides.

Good: "auth.ts:47 returns undefined when the session cookie expires. Users hit a white screen. Fix: add a null check and redirect to /login. Two lines."
Bad: "I've identified a potential issue in the authentication flow that may cause problems under certain conditions."

## Context Recovery

At session start or after compaction, recover recent project context.

```bash
eval "$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool 2>/dev/null)"
_PROJ="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}"
if [ -d "$_PROJ" ]; then
  echo "--- RECENT ARTIFACTS ---"
  find "$_PROJ/ceo-plans" "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | xargs -r ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -3
  [ -f "$_PROJ/${BRANCH:-unknown}-reviews.jsonl" ] && echo "REVIEWS: $(wc -l < "$_PROJ/${BRANCH:-unknown}-reviews.jsonl" | tr -d ' ') entries"
  [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ] && tail -5 "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ]; then
    _LAST=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -1)
    [ -n "$_LAST" ] && echo "LAST_SESSION: $_LAST"
    _RECENT_SKILLS=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -3 | grep -o '"skill":"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"skill":"//;s/"//' | tr '\n' ',')
    [ -n "$_RECENT_SKILLS" ] && echo "RECENT_PATTERN: $_RECENT_SKILLS"
  fi
  _LATEST_CP=$(find "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs -r ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  [ -n "$_LATEST_CP" ] && echo "LATEST_CHECKPOINT: $_LATEST_CP"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/decisions.active.json" ]; then
    echo "--- ACTIVE DECISIONS (recent, scope-relevant) ---"
    ~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool --recent 5 2>/dev/null
    echo "--- END DECISIONS ---"
  fi
  echo "--- END ARTIFACTS ---"
fi
```

If artifacts are listed, read the newest useful one. If `LAST_SESSION` or `LATEST_CHECKPOINT` appears, give a 2-sentence welcome back summary. If `RECENT_PATTERN` clearly implies a next skill, suggest it once.

**Cross-session decisions.** If `ACTIVE DECISIONS` are listed, treat them as prior settled calls with their rationale — do not silently re-litigate them; if you're about to reverse one, say so explicitly. Reach for `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool` whenever a question touches a past decision ("what did we decide / why / did we try"). When you or the user make a DURABLE decision (architecture, scope, tool/vendor choice, or a reversal) — NOT a turn-level or trivial choice — log it with `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# memory tool` (`--supersede <id>` for a reversal). Reliable and local; gbrain not required.

## Writing Style (skip entirely if `EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse` appears in the preamble echo OR the user's current message explicitly requests terse / no-explanations output)

Applies to AskUserQuestion, user replies, and findings. AskUserQuestion Format is structure; this is prose quality.

- Gloss curated jargon on first use per skill invocation, even if the user pasted the term.
- Frame questions in outcome terms: what pain is avoided, what capability unlocks, what user experience changes.
- Use short sentences, concrete nouns, active voice.
- Close decisions with user impact: what the user sees, waits for, loses, or gains.
- User-turn override wins: if the current message asks for terse / no explanations / just the answer, skip this section.
- Terse mode (EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse): no glosses, no outcome-framing layer, shorter responses.

Curated jargon list lives at `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/scripts/jargon-list.json` (80+ terms). On the first jargon term you encounter this session, Read that file once; treat the `terms` array as the canonical list. The list is repo-owned and may grow between releases.


## Completeness Principle — Boil the Ocean

AI makes completeness cheap, so the complete thing is the goal. Recommend full coverage (tests, edge cases, error paths) — boil the ocean one lake at a time. The only thing out of scope is genuinely unrelated work (rewrites, multi-quarter migrations); flag that as separate scope, never as an excuse for a shortcut.

When options differ in coverage, include `Completeness: X/10` (10 = all edge cases, 7 = happy path, 3 = shortcut). When options differ in kind, write: `Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.` Do not fabricate scores.

## Confusion Protocol

For high-stakes ambiguity (architecture, data model, destructive scope, missing context), STOP. Name it in one sentence, present 2-3 options with tradeoffs, and ask. Do not use for routine coding or obvious changes.

## Claimed Limitations Need Evidence

A claimed limitation or requirement ("the API can't do this", "X requires a credential", "that's impossible on this platform") is a material claim. State one only with the verbatim error, the documented statement, or a live probe in hand — pattern-matching a failure to a familiar story is not evidence. When a cheap probe settles the question, run it BEFORE asking the user anything or declaring a step blocked.

## Repo Ownership — See Something, Say Something

`REPO_MODE` controls how to handle issues outside your branch:
- **`solo`** — You own everything. Investigate and offer to fix proactively.
- **`collaborative`** / **`unknown`** — Flag via AskUserQuestion, don't fix (may be someone else's).

Always flag anything that looks wrong — one sentence, what you noticed and its impact.

## Search Before Building

Before building anything unfamiliar, **search first.** See `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/ETHOS.md`.
- **Layer 1** (tried and true) — don't reinvent. **Layer 2** (new and popular) — scrutinize. **Layer 3** (first principles) — prize above all.

**Eureka:** When first-principles reasoning contradicts conventional wisdom, name it and log:
```bash
jq -n --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --arg skill "SKILL_NAME" --arg branch "$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)" --arg insight "ONE_LINE_SUMMARY" '{ts:$ts,skill:$skill,branch:$branch,insight:$insight}' >> ~/.hermes/gstack/analytics/eureka.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

_Replaces gstack `gstack-learnings-log`. In Hermes, durable learnings are saved via the `memory` tool, and reusable workflows become `skill_manage` entries._

## Telemetry

_Replaces `gstack-skill-end`. In Hermes, log durable facts to `memory` and continue. The Hermes gateway handles cross-session metrics._

## Phase 0: Pre-checks

**Check for existing DESIGN.md:**

```bash
ls DESIGN.md design-system.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_DESIGN_FILE"
```

- If a DESIGN.md exists: Read it. Ask the user: "You already have a design system. Want to **update** it, **start fresh**, or **cancel**?"
- If no DESIGN.md: continue.

**Gather product context from the codebase:**

```bash
cat README.md 2>/dev/null | head -50
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | head -20
ls src/ app/ pages/ components/ 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

Look for office-hours output:

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
eval "$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool 2>/dev/null)"
ls ~/.hermes/gstack/projects/$SLUG/*office-hours* 2>/dev/null | head -5
ls .context/*office-hours* .context/attachments/*office-hours* 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

If office-hours output exists, read it — the product context is pre-filled.

If the codebase is empty and purpose is unclear, say: *"I don't have a clear picture of what you're building yet. Want to explore first with `/office-hours`? Once we know the product direction, we can set up the design system."*

**Find the browse binary (optional — enables visual competitive research):**

## DESIGN SETUP (run this check BEFORE any design mockup command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
D=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.hermes/skills/gstack/design/dist/design" ] && D="$_ROOT/.hermes/skills/gstack/design/dist/design"
[ -z "$D" ] && D="$HOME/.hermes/skills/gstack/design/dist/design"
if [ -x "$D" ]; then
  echo "DESIGN_READY: $D"
else
  echo "DESIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE"
fi
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.hermes/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.hermes/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "terminal" ] && B="$HOME/.hermes/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse"
if [ -x "terminal" ]; then
  echo "BROWSE_READY: terminal"
else
  echo "BROWSE_NOT_AVAILABLE (will use 'open' to view comparison boards)"
fi
```

If `DESIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE`: skip visual mockup generation and fall back to the
existing HTML wireframe approach (`DESIGN_SKETCH`). Design mockups are a
progressive enhancement, not a hard requirement.

If `BROWSE_NOT_AVAILABLE`: use `open file://...` instead of `terminal goto` to open
comparison boards. The user just needs to see the HTML file in any browser.

If `DESIGN_READY`: the design binary is available for visual mockup generation.
Commands:
- `$D generate --brief "..." --output /path.png` — generate a single mockup
- `$D variants --brief "..." --count 3 --output-dir /path/` — generate N style variants
- `$D compare --images "a.png,b.png,c.png" --output /path/board.html --serve` — comparison board + HTTP server
- `$D serve --html /path/board.html` — serve comparison board and collect feedback via HTTP
- `$D check --image /path.png --brief "..."` — vision quality gate
- `$D iterate --session /path/session.json --feedback "..." --output /path.png` — iterate

**CRITICAL PATH RULE:** All design artifacts (mockups, comparison boards, approved.json)
MUST be saved to `~/.hermes/gstack/projects/$SLUG/designs/`, NEVER to `.context/`,
`docs/designs/`, `/tmp/`, or any project-local directory. Design artifacts are USER
data, not project files. They persist across branches, conversations, and workspaces.

If `DESIGN_READY`: Phase 5 will generate AI mockups of your proposed design system applied to real screens, instead of just an HTML preview page. Much more powerful — the user sees what their product could actually look like.

If `DESIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE`: Phase 5 falls back to the HTML preview page (still good).

## Prior Learnings

Search for relevant learnings from previous sessions:

```bash
_CROSS_PROJ=$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get cross_project_learnings 2>/dev/null || echo "unset")
echo "CROSS_PROJECT: $_CROSS_PROJ"
if [ "$_CROSS_PROJ" = "true" ]; then
  ~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-learnings-search --limit 10 --cross-project 2>/dev/null || true
else
  ~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-learnings-search --limit 10 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

If `CROSS_PROJECT` is `unset` (first time): Use AskUserQuestion:

> gstack can search learnings from your other projects on this machine to find
> patterns that might apply here. This stays local (no data leaves your machine).
> Recommended for solo developers. Skip if you work on multiple client codebases
> where cross-contamination would be a concern.

Options:
- A) Enable cross-project learnings (recommended)
- B) Keep learnings project-scoped only

If A: run `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set cross_project_learnings true`
If B: run `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set cross_project_learnings false`

Then re-run the search with the appropriate flag.

If learnings are found, incorporate them into your analysis. When a review finding
matches a past learning, display:

**"Prior learning applied: [key] (confidence N/10, from [date])"**

This makes the compounding visible. The user should see that gstack is getting
smarter on their codebase over time.

## Section index — Read each section when its situation applies

This skill is a decision-tree skeleton. The steps below point to on-demand
sections. Read a section in full before doing its step; do not work from memory.

| When | Read this section |
|------|-------------------|
| building the complete design-system proposal, drill-downs, the design preview, and writing DESIGN.md (Phases 3-6, after product context and research) | `sections/proposal-and-preview.md` |

---

## Phase 1: Product Context

Ask the user a single question that covers everything you need to know. Pre-fill what you can infer from the codebase.

**AskUserQuestion Q1 — include ALL of these:**
1. Confirm what the product is, who it's for, what space/industry
2. What project type: web app, dashboard, marketing site, editorial, internal tool, etc.
3. "Want me to research what top products in your space are doing for design, or should I work from my design knowledge?"
4. **Explicitly say:** "At any point you can just drop into chat and we'll talk through anything — this isn't a rigid form, it's a conversation."

If the README or office-hours output gives you enough context, pre-fill and confirm: *"From what I can see, this is [X] for [Y] in the [Z] space. Sound right? And would you like me to research what's out there in this space, or should I work from what I know?"*

**Memorable-thing forcing question.** Before moving on, ask the user: *"What's the one
thing you want someone to remember after they see this product for the first time?"*

One sentence answer. Could be a feeling ("this is serious software for serious work"),
a visual ("the blue that's almost black"), a claim ("faster than anything else"), or
a posture ("for builders, not managers"). Write it down. Every subsequent design
decision should serve this memorable thing. Design that tries to be memorable for
everything is memorable for nothing.

### Taste profile (if this user has prior sessions)

Read the persistent taste profile if it exists:

```bash
_TASTE_PROFILE=~/.hermes/gstack/projects/$SLUG/taste-profile.json
if [ -f "$_TASTE_PROFILE" ]; then
  # Schema v1: { dimensions: { fonts, colors, layouts, aesthetics }, sessions: [] }
  # Each dimension has approved[] and rejected[] entries with
  # { value, confidence, approved_count, rejected_count, last_seen }
  # Confidence decays 5% per week of inactivity — computed at read time.
  cat "$_TASTE_PROFILE" 2>/dev/null | head -200
  echo "TASTE_PROFILE_FOUND"
else
  echo "NO_TASTE_PROFILE"
fi
```

**If TASTE_PROFILE_FOUND:** Summarize the strongest signals (top 3 approved entries
per dimension by confidence * approved_count). Include them in the design brief:

"Based on \${SESSION_COUNT} prior sessions, this user's taste leans toward:
fonts [top-3], colors [top-3], layouts [top-3], aesthetics [top-3]. Bias
generation toward these unless the user explicitly requests a different direction.
Also avoid their strong rejections: [top-3 rejected per dimension]."

**If NO_TASTE_PROFILE:** Fall through to per-session approved.json files (legacy).

**Conflict handling:** If the current user request contradicts a strong persistent
signal (e.g., "make it playful" when taste profile strongly prefers minimal), flag
it: "Note: your taste profile strongly prefers minimal. You're asking for playful
this time — I'll proceed, but want me to update the taste profile, or treat this
as a one-off?"

**Decay:** Confidence scores decay 5% per week. A font approved 6 months ago with
10 approvals has less weight than one approved last week. The decay calculation
happens at read time, not write time, so the file only grows on change.

**Schema migration:** If the file has no `version` field or `version: 0`, it's
the legacy approved.json aggregate — `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-taste-update`
will migrate it to schema v1 on the next write.

If a taste profile exists for this project, factor it into your Phase 3 proposal.
The profile reflects what the user has actually approved in prior sessions — treat
it as a demonstrated preference, not a constraint. You may still deliberately
depart from it if the product direction demands something different; when you do,
say so explicitly and connect the departure to the memorable-thing answer above.

---

## Phase 2: Research (only if user said yes)

If the user wants competitive research:

**Step 1: Identify what's out there via WebSearch**

Use WebSearch to find 5-10 products in their space. Search for:
- "[product category] website design"
- "[product category] best websites 2025"
- "best [industry] web apps"

**Step 2: Visual research via browse (if available)**

If the browse binary is available (`terminal` is set), visit the top 3-5 sites in the space and capture visual evidence:

```bash
terminal goto "https://example-site.com"
terminal screenshot "/tmp/design-research-site-name.png"
terminal snapshot
```

For each site, analyze: fonts actually used, color palette, layout approach, spacing density, aesthetic direction. The screenshot gives you the feel; the snapshot gives you structural data.

If a site blocks the headless browser or requires login, skip it and note why.

If browse is not available, rely on WebSearch results and your built-in design knowledge — this is fine.

**Step 3: Synthesize findings**

**Three-layer synthesis:**
- **Layer 1 (tried and true):** What design patterns does every product in this category share? These are table stakes — users expect them.
- **Layer 2 (new and popular):** What are the search results and current design discourse saying? What's trending? What new patterns are emerging?
- **Layer 3 (first principles):** Given what we know about THIS product's users and positioning — is there a reason the conventional design approach is wrong? Where should we deliberately break from the category norms?

**Eureka check:** If Layer 3 reasoning reveals a genuine design insight — a reason the category's visual language fails THIS product — name it: "EUREKA: Every [category] product does X because they assume [assumption]. But this product's users [evidence] — so we should do Y instead." Log the eureka moment (see preamble).

Summarize conversationally:
> "I looked at what's out there. Here's the landscape: they converge on [patterns]. Most of them feel [observation — e.g., interchangeable, polished but generic, etc.]. The opportunity to stand out is [gap]. Here's where I'd play it safe and where I'd take a risk..."

**Graceful degradation:**
- Browse available → screenshots + snapshots + WebSearch (richest research)
- Browse unavailable → WebSearch only (still good)
- WebSearch also unavailable → agent's built-in design knowledge (always works)

If the user said no research, skip entirely and proceed to Phase 3 using your built-in design knowledge.

---

## Design Outside Voices (parallel)

Use AskUserQuestion:
> "Want outside design voices? Codex evaluates against OpenAI's design hard rules + litmus checks; Claude subagent does an independent design direction proposal."
>
> A) Yes — run outside design voices
> B) No — proceed without

If user chooses B, skip this step and continue.

**Check Codex availability:**
```bash
command -v codex >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "CODEX_AVAILABLE" || echo "CODEX_NOT_AVAILABLE"
```

**If Codex is available**, launch both voices simultaneously:

1. **Codex design voice** (via Bash):
```bash
TMPERR_DESIGN=$(mktemp /tmp/codex-design-XXXXXXXX)
_REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) || { echo "ERROR: not in a git repo" >&2; exit 1; }
codex exec "Given this product context, propose a complete design direction:
- Visual thesis: one sentence describing mood, material, and energy
- Typography: specific font names (not defaults — no Inter/Roboto/Arial/system) + hex colors
- Color system: CSS variables for background, surface, primary text, muted text, accent
- Layout: composition-first, not component-first. First viewport as poster, not document
- Differentiation: 2 deliberate departures from category norms
- Anti-slop: no purple gradients, no 3-column icon grids, no centered everything, no decorative blobs

Be opinionated. Be specific. Do not hedge. This is YOUR design direction — own it." -C "$_REPO_ROOT" -s read-only -c 'model_reasoning_effort="medium"' -c 'web_search="cached"' < /dev/null 2>"$TMPERR_DESIGN"
```
Use a 5-minute timeout (`timeout: 300000`). After the command completes, read stderr:
```bash
cat "$TMPERR_DESIGN" && rm -f "$TMPERR_DESIGN"
```

2. **Claude design subagent** (via Agent tool):
Dispatch a subagent with this prompt:
"Given this product context, propose a design direction that would SURPRISE. What would the cool indie studio do that the enterprise UI team wouldn't?
- Propose an aesthetic direction, typography stack (specific font names), color palette (hex values)
- 2 deliberate departures from category norms
- What emotional reaction should the user have in the first 3 seconds?

Be bold. Be specific. No hedging."

**Error handling (all non-blocking):**
- **Auth failure:** If stderr contains "auth", "login", "unauthorized", or "API key": "Codex authentication failed. Run `codex login` to authenticate."
- **Timeout:** "Codex timed out after 5 minutes."
- **Empty response:** "Codex returned no response."
- On any Codex error: proceed with Claude subagent output only, tagged `[single-model]`.
- If Claude subagent also fails: "Outside voices unavailable — continuing with primary review."

Present Codex output under a `CODEX SAYS (design direction):` header.
Present subagent output under a `CLAUDE SUBAGENT (design direction):` header.

**Synthesis:** Claude main references both Codex and subagent proposals in the Phase 3 proposal. Present:
- Areas of agreement between all three voices (Claude main + Codex + subagent)
- Genuine divergences as creative alternatives for the user to choose from
- "Codex and I agree on X. Codex suggested Y where I'm proposing Z — here's why..."

**Log the result:**
```bash
~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-review-log '{"skill":"design-outside-voices","timestamp":"'"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"'","status":"STATUS","source":"SOURCE","commit":"'"$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"'"}'
```
Replace STATUS with "clean" or "issues_found", SOURCE with "codex+subagent", "codex-only", "subagent-only", or "unavailable".

> **STOP.** Before building the complete design-system proposal, drill-downs, the design preview, and writing DESIGN.md (Phases 3-6, after product context and research), Read `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/design-consultation/sections/proposal-and-preview.md` and execute it
> in full. Do not work from memory — that section is the source of truth for this step.
## Capture Learnings

If you discovered a non-obvious pattern, pitfall, or architectural insight during
this session, log it for future sessions:

```bash
~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# memory tool '{"skill":"design-consultation","type":"TYPE","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"SOURCE","files":["path/to/relevant/file"]}'
```

**Types:** `pattern` (reusable approach), `pitfall` (what NOT to do), `preference`
(user stated), `architecture` (structural decision), `tool` (library/framework insight),
`operational` (project environment/CLI/workflow knowledge).

**Sources:** `observed` (you found this in the code), `user-stated` (user told you),
`inferred` (AI deduction), `cross-model` (both Claude and Codex agree).

**Confidence:** 1-10. Be honest. An observed pattern you verified in the code is 8-9.
An inference you're not sure about is 4-5. A user preference they explicitly stated is 10.

**files:** Include the specific file paths this learning references. This enables
staleness detection: if those files are later deleted, the learning can be flagged.

**Only log genuine discoveries.** Don't log obvious things. Don't log things the user
already knows. A good test: would this insight save time in a future session? If yes, log it.



## Important Rules

1. **Propose, don't present menus.** You are a consultant, not a form. Make opinionated recommendations based on the product context, then let the user adjust.
2. **Every recommendation needs a rationale.** Never say "I recommend X" without "because Y."
3. **Coherence over individual choices.** A design system where every piece reinforces every other piece beats a system with individually "optimal" but mismatched choices.
4. **Never recommend blacklisted or overused fonts as primary.** If the user specifically requests one, comply but explain the tradeoff.
5. **The preview page must be beautiful.** It's the first visual output and sets the tone for the whole skill.
6. **Conversational tone.** This isn't a rigid workflow. If the user wants to talk through a decision, engage as a thoughtful design partner.
7. **Accept the user's final choice.** Nudge on coherence issues, but never block or refuse to write a DESIGN.md because you disagree with a choice.
8. **No AI slop in your own output.** Your recommendations, your preview page, your DESIGN.md — all should demonstrate the taste you're asking the user to adopt.
