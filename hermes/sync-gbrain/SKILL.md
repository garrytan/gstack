## When to Use

Wraps the gstack-gbrain-sync orchestrator with
state probing, native code-surface registration, capability checks,
and a verdict block. Re-runnable, idempotent. Use when: "sync gbrain",
"refresh gbrain", "re-index this repo", "gbrain search isn't finding
things".

## Preamble

_Replaces the gstack `gstack-skill-start` preamble. In Hermes, use `session_search` to recover prior context, then proceed._

## Decision-Brief Format

_Adapted from gstack's Claude Code AskUserQuestion spec. Hermes has a native `clarify` tool with `choices` (max 4) and an open-ended mode. Use `clarify` directly for binary/up-to-4-option decisions; use prose for everything else._

## Artifacts Sync

_Replaces gstack artifacts sync. In Hermes, `session_search` handles cross-session context recovery automatically._

## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

## Voice

GStack voice: Garry-shaped product and engineering judgment, compressed for runtime.

- Lead with the point. Say what it does, why it matters, and what changes for the builder.
- Be concrete. Name files, functions, line numbers, commands, outputs, evals, and real numbers.
- Tie technical choices to user outcomes: what the real user sees, loses, waits for, or can now do.
- Be direct about quality. Bugs matter. Edge cases matter. Fix the whole thing, not the demo path.
- Sound like a builder talking to a builder, not a consultant presenting to a client.
- Never corporate, academic, PR, or hype. Avoid filler, throat-clearing, generic optimism, and founder cosplay.
- No em dashes. No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted, furthermore, moreover, additionally, pivotal, landscape, tapestry, underscore, foster, showcase, intricate, vibrant, fundamental, significant.
- The user has context you do not: domain knowledge, timing, relationships, taste. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision. The user decides.

Good: "auth.ts:47 returns undefined when the session cookie expires. Users hit a white screen. Fix: add a null check and redirect to /login. Two lines."
Bad: "I've identified a potential issue in the authentication flow that may cause problems under certain conditions."

## Context Recovery

At session start or after compaction, recover recent project context.

```bash
eval "$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool 2>/dev/null)"
_PROJ="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}"
if [ -d "$_PROJ" ]; then
  echo "--- RECENT ARTIFACTS ---"
  find "$_PROJ/ceo-plans" "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | xargs -r ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -3
  [ -f "$_PROJ/${BRANCH:-unknown}-reviews.jsonl" ] && echo "REVIEWS: $(wc -l < "$_PROJ/${BRANCH:-unknown}-reviews.jsonl" | tr -d ' ') entries"
  [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ] && tail -5 "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ]; then
    _LAST=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -1)
    [ -n "$_LAST" ] && echo "LAST_SESSION: $_LAST"
    _RECENT_SKILLS=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -3 | grep -o '"skill":"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"skill":"//;s/"//' | tr '\n' ',')
    [ -n "$_RECENT_SKILLS" ] && echo "RECENT_PATTERN: $_RECENT_SKILLS"
  fi
  _LATEST_CP=$(find "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs -r ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  [ -n "$_LATEST_CP" ] && echo "LATEST_CHECKPOINT: $_LATEST_CP"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/decisions.active.json" ]; then
    echo "--- ACTIVE DECISIONS (recent, scope-relevant) ---"
    ~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool --recent 5 2>/dev/null
    echo "--- END DECISIONS ---"
  fi
  echo "--- END ARTIFACTS ---"
fi
```

If artifacts are listed, read the newest useful one. If `LAST_SESSION` or `LATEST_CHECKPOINT` appears, give a 2-sentence welcome back summary. If `RECENT_PATTERN` clearly implies a next skill, suggest it once.

**Cross-session decisions.** If `ACTIVE DECISIONS` are listed, treat them as prior settled calls with their rationale — do not silently re-litigate them; if you're about to reverse one, say so explicitly. Reach for `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool` whenever a question touches a past decision ("what did we decide / why / did we try"). When you or the user make a DURABLE decision (architecture, scope, tool/vendor choice, or a reversal) — NOT a turn-level or trivial choice — log it with `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# memory tool` (`--supersede <id>` for a reversal). Reliable and local; gbrain not required.

## Writing Style (skip entirely if `EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse` appears in the preamble echo OR the user's current message explicitly requests terse / no-explanations output)

Applies to AskUserQuestion, user replies, and findings. AskUserQuestion Format is structure; this is prose quality.

- Gloss curated jargon on first use per skill invocation, even if the user pasted the term.
- Frame questions in outcome terms: what pain is avoided, what capability unlocks, what user experience changes.
- Use short sentences, concrete nouns, active voice.
- Close decisions with user impact: what the user sees, waits for, loses, or gains.
- User-turn override wins: if the current message asks for terse / no explanations / just the answer, skip this section.
- Terse mode (EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse): no glosses, no outcome-framing layer, shorter responses.

Curated jargon list lives at `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/scripts/jargon-list.json` (80+ terms). On the first jargon term you encounter this session, Read that file once; treat the `terms` array as the canonical list. The list is repo-owned and may grow between releases.


## Completeness Principle — Boil the Ocean

AI makes completeness cheap, so the complete thing is the goal. Recommend full coverage (tests, edge cases, error paths) — boil the ocean one lake at a time. The only thing out of scope is genuinely unrelated work (rewrites, multi-quarter migrations); flag that as separate scope, never as an excuse for a shortcut.

When options differ in coverage, include `Completeness: X/10` (10 = all edge cases, 7 = happy path, 3 = shortcut). When options differ in kind, write: `Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.` Do not fabricate scores.

## Confusion Protocol

For high-stakes ambiguity (architecture, data model, destructive scope, missing context), STOP. Name it in one sentence, present 2-3 options with tradeoffs, and ask. Do not use for routine coding or obvious changes.

## Claimed Limitations Need Evidence

A claimed limitation or requirement ("the API can't do this", "X requires a credential", "that's impossible on this platform") is a material claim. State one only with the verbatim error, the documented statement, or a live probe in hand — pattern-matching a failure to a familiar story is not evidence. When a cheap probe settles the question, run it BEFORE asking the user anything or declaring a step blocked.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

_Replaces gstack `gstack-learnings-log`. In Hermes, durable learnings are saved via the `memory` tool, and reusable workflows become `skill_manage` entries._

## Telemetry

_Replaces `gstack-skill-end`. In Hermes, log durable facts to `memory` and continue. The Hermes gateway handles cross-session metrics._

## User-invocable

When the user types `/sync-gbrain`, run this skill. Argument modes (parsed by
the skill itself, not a dispatcher binary):

- `/sync-gbrain` — incremental sync (default; mtime fast-path; ~50ms steady-state)
- `/sync-gbrain --full` — full code reindex via `gbrain reindex-code` (~25-35 min on a big repo). Auto-builds the call graph (`gbrain dream`) **only when it was never built**.
- `/sync-gbrain --dream` — build this source's call graph (`gbrain code-callers`/`code-callees`) via a source-scoped `gbrain dream --source <id>` cycle; ~minutes; runs lock-free after the sync stages. Always forces, even if already built. Only produces a graph on a code-aware schema pack; otherwise the run reports a WARN explaining why the graph is still empty.
- `/sync-gbrain --no-dream` — skip the dream cycle that `--full` would otherwise auto-run.
- `/sync-gbrain --code-only` — only run the code stage; skip memory + brain-sync
- `/sync-gbrain --dry-run` — preview what would sync; no writes anywhere
- `/sync-gbrain --no-memory` / `--no-brain-sync` — selectively skip stages
- `/sync-gbrain --quiet` — suppress per-stage output
- `/sync-gbrain --refresh-cache` — force-rebuild brain-aware planning cache (v1.48; replaces /brain-refresh-context per D1 fold). Skips code + memory stages; routes to `gstack-brain-cache refresh --project <slug>`.
- `/sync-gbrain --audit` — emit summary of gstack-owned pages per project + sensitive-content audit (v1.48 / D10 lifecycle). Read-only.

Pass-through args go straight to the orchestrator at
`~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-gbrain-sync.ts`.

**`--refresh-cache` short-circuit:** when this flag is present, the skill
runs ONLY the cache refresh (`gstack-brain-cache refresh --project <slug>`
for the current worktree's slug, plus a cross-project refresh of
user-profile if `gstack/user-profile/<user-slug>` exists). Code +
memory + brain-sync stages are skipped. Useful when the user knows the
brain has new info gstack should pick up before the next planning skill.

**`--audit` short-circuit:** when this flag is present, the skill runs
`gstack-brain-cache list --project <slug> --json`, summarizes by page
type, then scans for any cached salience entries that ended up outside
the SALIENCE_DEFAULT_ALLOWLIST (T17 / D9 leak check). Read-only; no
modifications to brain or cache.

---

## Step 1: State probe

Before doing anything, check that /setup-gbrain has been run on this Mac.

```bash
~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-gbrain-detect 2>/dev/null
```

**Brain trust policy gate (v1.48 / Phase 1.5 / D4 — added by T13+T5c):**
If `gbrain_mcp_mode == "remote-http"` from the detect output AND the per-
endpoint policy is `unset`, the policy question MUST fire here before
the orchestrator runs. Local engines auto-set to `personal` silently per
the per-transport default table.

```bash
_HASH=$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config endpoint-hash 2>/dev/null)
_POLICY=$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get brain_trust_policy@$_HASH 2>/dev/null || echo unset)
echo "BRAIN_TRUST_POLICY[$_HASH]: $_POLICY"
```

If `_POLICY == "unset"` AND `_HASH != "local"`, AskUserQuestion per the
Step 9.5 wording in `/setup-gbrain` (personal vs shared, with persistence
to `brain_trust_policy@<hash>` and conditional `artifacts_sync_mode=full`
flip for personal). Then continue.

If `_POLICY == "unset"` AND `_HASH == "local"`, auto-set personal:

```bash
~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set brain_trust_policy@$_HASH personal
```

**Split-engine model (v1.34.0.0+).** Code stage runs locally against the
per-machine gbrain engine (PGLite or whatever `gbrain config` points to),
with each worktree of a repo registered as its own source. **Memory stage
also runs locally** in local-stdio MCP mode — `gstack-memory-ingest` shells
out to `gbrain import` against the same local engine. In remote-http MCP
mode (Path 4), the memory stage instead persists staged markdown to
`~/.hermes/gstack/transcripts/<run-id>/` and the artifacts pipeline pushes it to
the brain admin's pull job (plan D11). Brain-sync (the `# memory tool / session_search`
push to git) is the one stage that never touches local engine and runs
regardless of mode.

Practically: local PGLite stays code-only on remote-http machines; the
remote brain holds everything else. Local-stdio machines mix code +
transcripts in one local engine, as they always have.

Also check the per-repo trust policy. If `gstack-gbrain-repo-policy get` for
this repo returns `deny`, STOP:

> "This repo's gbrain trust policy is `deny`. Run `/setup-gbrain --repo` to
> change it before syncing."

---

## Step 1.5: Local engine pre-flight (plan D12)

Read `gbrain_local_status` from the Step 1 detect output. Branch as follows
BEFORE invoking the orchestrator:

- **`ok`**: proceed to Step 2 normally.
- **`timeout`**: proceed to Step 2 — the engine is most likely healthy but
  slow (cold pooler connection, #1964). Tell the user in one line: "Engine
  probe timed out (>15s) — proceeding; raise `GSTACK_GBRAIN_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS`
  if your pooler is slow." Do NOT treat this as a broken config.
- **`thin-client`**: proceed to Step 2 — this machine is a thin client of a
  remote-HTTP MCP brain (#2051): no local engine BY DESIGN, so the code,
  memory, and dream stages will SKIP with a thin-client reason (code indexing
  runs on the brain server; memory syncs via the remote brain's artifacts
  pull). Only the brain-sync push runs locally. Tell the user in one line:
  "Thin client of a remote brain — local stages skip by design; brain queries
  work via remote MCP (reachability is verified at use time, not probed
  here)." Do NOT route this into the broken-config remediation.
- **`engine-locked`**: STOP. "The local PGLite database is busy, usually
  because `gbrain serve` from a live Claude session owns it. Stop that process
  or run `/sync-gbrain` outside the live session, then retry. This identifies
  the conflict but does not remove PGLite's single-process limit."
- **`no-cli`**: STOP. "Local gbrain CLI not installed. Run `/setup-gbrain`
  first."
- **`missing-config`** AND `gbrain_mcp_mode == "remote-http"`: tell the user
  "Your brain queries (the `mcp__gbrain__*` tools) work via remote MCP, but
  symbol code search needs a local PGLite. Run `/setup-gbrain` and pick
  'Yes' at the new 'local code index' prompt (Step 4.5), or run
  `gbrain init --pglite --json --embedding-model voyage:voyage-code-3 --embedding-dimensions 1024`
  directly (drop the voyage flags if `VOYAGE_API_KEY` isn't set). Continuing
  without code stage."
  Then proceed to Step 2 — the orchestrator's `runCodeImport()` and
  `runMemoryIngest()` will return SKIP per plan D12; only `runBrainSyncPush()`
  will run. Do NOT abort.
- **`missing-config`** AND `gbrain_mcp_mode != "remote-http"`: STOP. "Local
  gbrain CLI is installed but no engine config. Run `/setup-gbrain` first."
- **`broken-config`** OR **`broken-db`**: STOP with a clear message:
  ```
  Local gbrain config at ~/.gbrain/config.json points at an unreachable
  engine (status: {gbrain_local_status}). Two options:
    1. Re-run /setup-gbrain — Step 1.5 offers Retry / Switch to PGLite /
       Switch brain mode / Quit (plan D4).
    2. Repair manually: mv ~/.gbrain/config.json ~/.gbrain/config.json.bak
       && gbrain init --pglite --json --embedding-model voyage:voyage-code-3 \
          --embedding-dimensions 1024   (drop voyage flags if VOYAGE_API_KEY unset)
  Re-run /sync-gbrain after.
  ```
  Do NOT continue — the orchestrator would skip code+memory and only run
  brain-sync, which is a degraded state the user should fix explicitly.

This pre-flight short-circuits the orchestrator before it spends ~80ms
probing the engine again. The orchestrator independently runs the same
classifier for defense-in-depth, but Step 1.5's STOP is where the user
gets the actionable remediation message.

---

## Step 2: Run the orchestrator

Pass user args to the orchestrator. Do not paraphrase them — pass through
as-is.

```bash
bun run ~/.hermes/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-gbrain-sync.ts <user-args>
```

The orchestrator runs three stages: code → memory → brain-sync (per the
plan's storage tiering). Each stage failure is non-fatal; subsequent stages
still run. State is persisted to `~/.hermes/gstack/.gbrain-sync-state.json` via
tmp-file + atomic rename. Concurrent runs are blocked by a lock file at
`~/.hermes/gstack/.sync-gbrain.lock` (5-min stale-takeover).

---

## Step 3: Code-index health check

After the sync run, query gbrain for the cwd source's page_count:

```bash
SOURCE_ID=$(grep -o '"source_id":"[^"]*"' ~/.hermes/gstack/.gbrain-sync-state.json 2>/dev/null \
  | head -1 | sed 's/.*"source_id":"//;s/".*//')
PAGES=$(gbrain sources list --json 2>/dev/null \
  | jq -r --arg id "$SOURCE_ID" '.sources[] | select(.id==$id) | .page_count' 2>/dev/null \
  || echo 0)
echo "cwd source: $SOURCE_ID, page_count: $PAGES"
```

If `PAGES` is 0 or empty AND the user did NOT pass `--no-code` AND mode was
not `--full`, AskUserQuestion via the format in the preamble:

> D1 — This repo has 0 indexed pages in gbrain. Run a full code reindex now?
>
> ELI10: gbrain hasn't indexed this repo's code yet. The semantic search
> tools (`gbrain search`, `code-def`, `code-refs`) will return nothing
> until we run a full pass. Takes ~25-35 minutes on a big Mac.
>
> Recommendation: A — the brain is unusable for code search until indexed,
> and Step 2 of this skill already verified gbrain is configured correctly.
>
> Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.
>
> A) Run /sync-gbrain --full now (recommended)
> B) Skip — I'll run it later

If A: re-invoke the orchestrator with `--full --code-only`.
If B: continue to Step 4 with the empty-corpus state recorded.

---

## Step 3.5: Call-graph health check (offer `--dream`)

`gbrain code-callers` / `code-callees` (who-calls-this / what-this-calls) return
`count: 0` until a `gbrain dream` cycle runs the `resolve_symbol_edges` phase for
this source — not done by the code import in Step 2.

**One hard prerequisite:** building a call graph requires this source's active
**schema pack to extract code symbols** (the `extract_atoms` phase). On a pack
that doesn't declare it (e.g. `gbrain-base` / `gbrain-base-v2`), a `dream` cycle
completes but `resolve_symbol_edges` matches nothing — the graph stays empty no
matter how many times you run it. So "build the call graph" is only meaningful on
a code-aware pack. The `--dream` stage detects this and reports it honestly
(a WARN row) rather than claiming a build that didn't happen. gbrain exposes pack
capability only at cycle runtime (no pre-flight query as of 0.41.x), so we can't
detect it before running. `code-def` / `code-refs` need the same symbol
extraction; they are NOT free "direct lookups" on a non-code-aware pack.

Detect whether this source's call graph is built via doctor's `cycle_freshness`
check, matching the cwd `SOURCE_ID` literally:

```bash
SOURCE_ID=$(grep -o '"source_id":"[^"]*"' ~/.hermes/gstack/.gbrain-sync-state.json 2>/dev/null \
  | head -1 | sed 's/.*"source_id":"//;s/".*//')
CYCLE=$(gbrain doctor --json --fast 2>/dev/null \
  | jq -r --arg id "$SOURCE_ID" '
      (.checks[] | select(.name=="cycle_freshness")) as $c
      | if $c.status=="ok" then "completed"
        elif ($c.message | index($id)) then "never"
        else "unknown" end' 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)
# index($id) = literal substring (NOT test() regex), matching the lib reader in
# cycleCompleted(). A fail/warn that doesn't name this source → "unknown" (don't
# mask other-source failures).
echo "call graph for $SOURCE_ID: $CYCLE"
```

If `CYCLE == never` AND the user did NOT pass `--dream`/`--full` AND Step 3
`PAGES > 0`, AskUserQuestion via the format in the preamble:

> D2 — This repo's call graph isn't built. Build it now?
>
> ELI10: `gbrain code-callers`/`code-callees` (who calls this function / what it
> calls) return nothing until the `resolve_symbol_edges` phase runs for this
> source. `gbrain dream --source <this source>` runs it (scoped to this
> worktree's code, takes a few minutes). It only produces a graph if this
> source's schema pack extracts code symbols; if it doesn't, the run completes
> but the graph stays empty and the dream row will say so.
>
> Recommendation: A — call-graph queries return 0 until this runs, and the code
> index is already populated. If A comes back as a WARN ("pack does not extract
> code symbols"), the fix is a code-aware schema pack, not re-running dream.
>
> Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.
>
> A) Run /sync-gbrain --dream now (recommended)
> B) Skip — I'll run it later

If A: re-invoke the orchestrator with `--dream --code-only` (skips memory +
brain-sync; the dream stage still runs because it's gated on `--dream`). Then
report the dream stage's ACTUAL row — `OK call graph built (N edges)` vs a
`WARN` that names why the graph is still empty (non-code-aware pack, missing
embedding key, or 0 edges matched). Do not claim success on a WARN.
If B: continue to Step 4 with the call-graph-not-built state recorded for the
verdict.

If `CYCLE == completed` or `unknown`, do not prompt — but note `completed` means
only that a cycle has run, not that edges exist (a non-code-aware pack reports
`completed` with an empty graph). Step 5's verdict row surfaces the real state.

---

## Step 4: Refresh `## GBrain Search Guidance` block in AGENTS.md

Capability check (per /plan-eng-review §6):

```bash
SLUG="_capability_check_$$"
CAPABILITY_OK=0
if [ -f ~/.gbrain/config.json ] && \
   gbrain --version 2>/dev/null | grep -q '^gbrain '; then
  # Do NOT export GBRAIN_PREPARE here (#1965). gbrain auto-disables prepared
  # statements on transaction-mode poolers (port 6543) — forcing them on
  # breaks every write with "prepared statement does not exist". Users on a
  # session-mode pooler at 6543 can set GBRAIN_PREPARE=true themselves (the
  # gbrain banner documents this override).
  if echo "ping" | gbrain put "$SLUG" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # Retry search up to 3 times with 1s delay — under transaction-mode
    # pooling the search index may not be visible on the next connection
    # immediately after the put.
    for _attempt in 1 2 3; do
      if gbrain search "ping" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "$SLUG"; then
        CAPABILITY_OK=1
        break
      fi
      sleep 1
    done
  fi
fi
gbrain delete "$SLUG" 2>/dev/null || true
# #2503: on worktree-pinned brains `gbrain put` can materialize the page as
# <slug>.md in the CURRENT directory (the user's repo), and `gbrain delete`
# removes the page, not the file. Remove the litter explicitly.
rm -f "./${SLUG}.md" 2>/dev/null || true
```

Then update AGENTS.md based on capability state:

**If `CAPABILITY_OK=1`** — write or update the block. Idempotent: find the
HTML-comment-delimited block; replace its body if it exists; append at the
end of AGENTS.md if it doesn't. NEVER duplicate. Block is machine-AGNOSTIC
(no engine, no page counts, no last-sync time — those are in the existing
`## GBrain Configuration` block).

Verbatim block content (copy exactly):

```markdown
## GBrain Search Guidance (configured by /sync-gbrain)
<!-- gstack-gbrain-search-guidance:start -->

GBrain is set up and synced on this machine. The agent should prefer gbrain
over Grep when the question is semantic or when you don't know the exact
identifier yet.

**This worktree is pinned to a worktree-scoped code source** via the
`.gbrain-source` file in the repo root (kubectl-style context).
`gbrain code-def`, `code-refs`, `code-callers`, `code-callees`, `search`, and
`query` from anywhere under this worktree route to that source by default —
no `--source` flag needed (gbrain >= 0.41.38.0; on older gbrain the call-graph
commands need `--source "$(cat .gbrain-source)"`). Conductor sibling worktrees
of the same repo each have their own pin and their own indexed pages, so
semantic results match the code on disk here.

Call-graph queries (`code-callers`/`code-callees`) also need the graph to be
built first — run `/sync-gbrain --dream` (or `--full`) if they return
`count: 0`. This only works if this source's gbrain schema pack extracts code
symbols; on a non-code-aware pack `--dream` completes but the graph stays empty
and reports a WARN. `code-def`/`code-refs` need the same extraction.

Two indexed corpora available via the `gbrain` CLI:
- This worktree's code (auto-pinned via `.gbrain-source`).
- `~/.hermes/gstack/` curated memory (registered as `gstack-brain-<user>` source via
  the existing federation pipeline).

Prefer gbrain when:
- "Where is X handled?" / semantic intent, no exact string yet:
    `gbrain search "<terms>"` or `gbrain query "<question>"`
- "Where is symbol Y defined?" / symbol-based code questions:
    `gbrain code-def <symbol>` or `gbrain code-refs <symbol>`
- "What calls Y?" / "What does Y depend on?":
    `gbrain code-callers <symbol>` / `gbrain code-callees <symbol>`
- "What did we decide last time?" / past plans, retros, learnings:
    `gbrain search "<terms>" --source gstack-brain-<user>`

Grep is still right for known exact strings, regex, multiline patterns, and
file globs. Run `/sync-gbrain` after meaningful code changes; for ongoing
auto-sync across all worktrees, run `gbrain autopilot --install` once per
machine — gbrain's daemon handles incremental refresh on a schedule.

Safety: don't run `/sync-gbrain` while `gbrain autopilot` is active — the
orchestrator refuses destructive source ops when it detects a running autopilot
to avoid racing it (#1734). Prefer registering user repos with `gbrain sources
add --path <dir>` (no `--url`): URL-managed sources can auto-reclone, and the
sync code walk for them requires an explicit `--allow-reclone` opt-in.

<!-- gstack-gbrain-search-guidance:end -->
```

Use the Read + Edit tools. The find-and-replace target is the entire region
from `<!-- gstack-gbrain-search-guidance:start -->` through
`<!-- gstack-gbrain-search-guidance:end -->`. If those markers are missing,
search for `## GBrain Search Guidance (configured by /sync-gbrain)` heading
and replace from there to the next `## ` or EOF. If no heading exists, append
the entire block at the end of AGENTS.md.

**Atomic write:** write the new AGENTS.md content to a tmp file alongside it
(e.g., `AGENTS.md.sync-gbrain.tmp`) then `mv` to atomic-rename, so a crash
mid-write never leaves the file half-modified.

**If `CAPABILITY_OK=0`** — REMOVE the block entirely if present. Use the same
Edit tool to strip the start/end-marker region. The `## GBrain Configuration`
block stays in place (it's a record of the install, not a capability claim).

Do NOT crash if AGENTS.md is missing or unwritable — log a warning and
continue.

## Step 5: Verdict block (idempotent doctor output)

Print a status block matching `/setup-gbrain` Step 10 conventions. Each row
is `[OK]/[FIX]/[WARN]/[ERR]`. Reuse `gbrain doctor --json --fast` for
informational rows but DO NOT gate the guidance block on doctor (per
/plan-eng-review §6 — doctor is too strict for unrelated reasons).

```
gbrain status: GREEN

  CLI ............. OK   <gbrain version>
  Engine .......... OK   <pglite|supabase>
  Capability ...... OK   write+search round-trip
  CWD source ...... OK   <gstack-code-{repo_slug}> (page_count=<N>)
  Call graph ...... OK   <N> edges resolved (code-callers/callees live)
  ~/.gstack source. OK   <gstack-brain-{user}> (page_count=<N>) — managed by /setup-gbrain
  Memory sync ..... OK   <artifacts_sync_mode>
  AGENTS.md ....... OK   ## GBrain Search Guidance present
  Last sync ....... OK   <last_sync from state file>

Run `/sync-gbrain` again any time gbrain feels off; safe and idempotent.
```

The **Call graph** row reports the most authoritative signal available:

1. **If a dream stage ran this invocation** (`--dream`, or `--full` auto-build),
   mirror its row verbatim — it's the ground truth for this run:
   - `OK   <N> edges resolved (code-callers/callees live)`
   - `WARN dream ran but this source's schema pack does not extract code symbols
     — switch to a code-aware pack (\`gbrain schema use <pack>\`)`
   - `WARN dream ran but the embed phase failed (missing embedding key)`
   - `WARN dream ran but resolved 0 edges (no code symbols matched yet)`
2. **Otherwise** fall back to the `CYCLE` value from Step 3.5, with honest wording
   (a completed cycle proves a cycle ran, NOT that edges exist):
   - `completed` → `OK   cycle complete — code-callers/callees live IF this source's pack extracts code symbols`
   - `never` → `WARN call graph not built — run /sync-gbrain --dream`
   - `unknown` → `WARN could not probe call graph (doctor unavailable) — run /sync-gbrain --dream if code-callers returns 0`

Any `WARN` Call graph row flips the verdict to YELLOW.

If any row is YELLOW or RED, the verdict line says so and the failing rows
surface a one-line "next action" (e.g., `Capability ...... ERR  capability
check failed; AGENTS.md guidance block REMOVED — run /setup-gbrain to repair`).
A `never`/`unknown` Call graph row flips the verdict to YELLOW.

## Concurrency note

This skill is safe to run concurrently from multiple terminals on the same
Mac. The orchestrator acquires a lock at `~/.hermes/gstack/.sync-gbrain.lock` before
any state-file or AGENTS.md mutation and exits with code 2 if another sync is
in flight. Stale locks (process died) auto-clear after 5 minutes.

## Cross-machine note

The `## GBrain Search Guidance` block is committed to the repo's AGENTS.md
and travels with `git push`/`git pull` — NOT through `~/.hermes/gstack/.brain-allowlist`
(which is for `~/.hermes/gstack/` brain-sync only). On a different Mac with a synced
AGENTS.md but no local gbrain, /sync-gbrain detects the mismatch via the
capability check and REMOVES the block (the local agent shouldn't be told to
use a tool that isn't installed).

## Status reporting

End with a Completion Status (per the preamble protocol):
- **DONE** — all stages green, AGENTS.md guidance block present, verdict GREEN.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — sync ran but at least one stage failed or capability
  check failed. List which.
- **BLOCKED** — could not acquire lock, gbrain not on PATH, or per-repo policy
  is deny. State the blocker.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — /setup-gbrain has not been run, or `gbrain doctor` shows
  a state that requires user decision (e.g., engine migration).
