## When to Use

Detects your deploy
platform (Fly.io, Render, Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, GitHub Actions, custom),
production URL, health check endpoints, and deploy status commands. Writes
the configuration to AGENTS.md so all future deploys are automatic.
Use when: "setup deploy", "configure deployment", "set up land-and-deploy",
"how do I deploy with gstack", "add deploy config".

## Preamble

_Replaces the gstack `gstack-skill-start` preamble. In Hermes, use `session_search` to recover prior context, then proceed._

## Decision-Brief Format

_Adapted from gstack's Claude Code AskUserQuestion spec. Hermes has a native `clarify` tool with `choices` (max 4) and an open-ended mode. Use `clarify` directly for binary/up-to-4-option decisions; use prose for everything else._

## Artifacts Sync

_Replaces gstack artifacts sync. In Hermes, `session_search` handles cross-session context recovery automatically._

## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

## Voice

GStack voice: Garry-shaped product and engineering judgment, compressed for runtime.

- Lead with the point. Say what it does, why it matters, and what changes for the builder.
- Be concrete. Name files, functions, line numbers, commands, outputs, evals, and real numbers.
- Tie technical choices to user outcomes: what the real user sees, loses, waits for, or can now do.
- Be direct about quality. Bugs matter. Edge cases matter. Fix the whole thing, not the demo path.
- Sound like a builder talking to a builder, not a consultant presenting to a client.
- Never corporate, academic, PR, or hype. Avoid filler, throat-clearing, generic optimism, and founder cosplay.
- No em dashes. No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted, furthermore, moreover, additionally, pivotal, landscape, tapestry, underscore, foster, showcase, intricate, vibrant, fundamental, significant.
- The user has context you do not: domain knowledge, timing, relationships, taste. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision. The user decides.

Good: "auth.ts:47 returns undefined when the session cookie expires. Users hit a white screen. Fix: add a null check and redirect to /login. Two lines."
Bad: "I've identified a potential issue in the authentication flow that may cause problems under certain conditions."

## Context Recovery

At session start or after compaction, recover recent project context.

```bash
eval "$(~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool 2>/dev/null)"
_PROJ="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}"
if [ -d "$_PROJ" ]; then
  echo "--- RECENT ARTIFACTS ---"
  find "$_PROJ/ceo-plans" "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | xargs -r ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -3
  [ -f "$_PROJ/${BRANCH:-unknown}-reviews.jsonl" ] && echo "REVIEWS: $(wc -l < "$_PROJ/${BRANCH:-unknown}-reviews.jsonl" | tr -d ' ') entries"
  [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ] && tail -5 "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" ]; then
    _LAST=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -1)
    [ -n "$_LAST" ] && echo "LAST_SESSION: $_LAST"
    _RECENT_SKILLS=$(grep "\"branch\":\"${_BRANCH}\"" "$_PROJ/timeline.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | grep '"event":"completed"' | tail -3 | grep -o '"skill":"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"skill":"//;s/"//' | tr '\n' ',')
    [ -n "$_RECENT_SKILLS" ] && echo "RECENT_PATTERN: $_RECENT_SKILLS"
  fi
  _LATEST_CP=$(find "$_PROJ/checkpoints" -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs -r ls -t 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  [ -n "$_LATEST_CP" ] && echo "LATEST_CHECKPOINT: $_LATEST_CP"
  if [ -f "$_PROJ/decisions.active.json" ]; then
    echo "--- ACTIVE DECISIONS (recent, scope-relevant) ---"
    ~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool --recent 5 2>/dev/null
    echo "--- END DECISIONS ---"
  fi
  echo "--- END ARTIFACTS ---"
fi
```

If artifacts are listed, read the newest useful one. If `LAST_SESSION` or `LATEST_CHECKPOINT` appears, give a 2-sentence welcome back summary. If `RECENT_PATTERN` clearly implies a next skill, suggest it once.

**Cross-session decisions.** If `ACTIVE DECISIONS` are listed, treat them as prior settled calls with their rationale — do not silently re-litigate them; if you're about to reverse one, say so explicitly. Reach for `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# session_search tool` whenever a question touches a past decision ("what did we decide / why / did we try"). When you or the user make a DURABLE decision (architecture, scope, tool/vendor choice, or a reversal) — NOT a turn-level or trivial choice — log it with `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/# memory tool` (`--supersede <id>` for a reversal). Reliable and local; gbrain not required.

## Writing Style (skip entirely if `EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse` appears in the preamble echo OR the user's current message explicitly requests terse / no-explanations output)

Applies to AskUserQuestion, user replies, and findings. AskUserQuestion Format is structure; this is prose quality.

- Gloss curated jargon on first use per skill invocation, even if the user pasted the term.
- Frame questions in outcome terms: what pain is avoided, what capability unlocks, what user experience changes.
- Use short sentences, concrete nouns, active voice.
- Close decisions with user impact: what the user sees, waits for, loses, or gains.
- User-turn override wins: if the current message asks for terse / no explanations / just the answer, skip this section.
- Terse mode (EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse): no glosses, no outcome-framing layer, shorter responses.

Curated jargon list lives at `~/.hermes/skills/gstack/scripts/jargon-list.json` (80+ terms). On the first jargon term you encounter this session, Read that file once; treat the `terms` array as the canonical list. The list is repo-owned and may grow between releases.


## Completeness Principle — Boil the Ocean

AI makes completeness cheap, so the complete thing is the goal. Recommend full coverage (tests, edge cases, error paths) — boil the ocean one lake at a time. The only thing out of scope is genuinely unrelated work (rewrites, multi-quarter migrations); flag that as separate scope, never as an excuse for a shortcut.

When options differ in coverage, include `Completeness: X/10` (10 = all edge cases, 7 = happy path, 3 = shortcut). When options differ in kind, write: `Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.` Do not fabricate scores.

## Confusion Protocol

For high-stakes ambiguity (architecture, data model, destructive scope, missing context), STOP. Name it in one sentence, present 2-3 options with tradeoffs, and ask. Do not use for routine coding or obvious changes.

## Claimed Limitations Need Evidence

A claimed limitation or requirement ("the API can't do this", "X requires a credential", "that's impossible on this platform") is a material claim. State one only with the verbatim error, the documented statement, or a live probe in hand — pattern-matching a failure to a familiar story is not evidence. When a cheap probe settles the question, run it BEFORE asking the user anything or declaring a step blocked.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

_Replaces gstack `gstack-learnings-log`. In Hermes, durable learnings are saved via the `memory` tool, and reusable workflows become `skill_manage` entries._

## Telemetry

_Replaces `gstack-skill-end`. In Hermes, log durable facts to `memory` and continue. The Hermes gateway handles cross-session metrics._

## User-invocable
When the user types `/setup-deploy`, run this skill.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check existing configuration

```bash
grep -A 20 "## Deploy Configuration" AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_CONFIG"
```

If configuration already exists, show it and ask:

- **Context:** Deploy configuration already exists in AGENTS.md.
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Choose A to update if your setup changed.
- A) Reconfigure from scratch (overwrite existing)
- B) Edit specific fields (show current config, let me change one thing)
- C) Done — configuration looks correct

If the user picks C, stop.

### Step 2: Detect platform

Run the platform detection from the deploy bootstrap:

```bash
# Platform config files
[ -f fly.toml ] && echo "PLATFORM:fly" && cat fly.toml
[ -f render.yaml ] && echo "PLATFORM:render" && cat render.yaml
[ -f vercel.json ] || [ -d .vercel ] && echo "PLATFORM:vercel"
[ -f netlify.toml ] && echo "PLATFORM:netlify" && cat netlify.toml
[ -f Procfile ] && echo "PLATFORM:heroku"
[ -f railway.json ] || [ -f railway.toml ] && echo "PLATFORM:railway"

# GitHub Actions deploy workflows
for f in $(find .github/workflows -maxdepth 1 \( -name '*.yml' -o -name '*.yaml' \) 2>/dev/null); do
  [ -f "$f" ] && grep -qiE "deploy|release|production|staging|cd" "$f" 2>/dev/null && echo "DEPLOY_WORKFLOW:$f"
done

# Project type
[ -f package.json ] && grep -q '"bin"' package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "PROJECT_TYPE:cli"
find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.gemspec' 2>/dev/null | grep -q . && echo "PROJECT_TYPE:library"
```

### Step 3: Platform-specific setup

Based on what was detected, guide the user through platform-specific configuration.

#### Fly.io

If `fly.toml` detected:

1. Extract app name: `grep -m1 "^app" fly.toml | sed 's/app = "\(.*\)"/\1/'`
2. Check if `fly` CLI is installed: `which fly 2>/dev/null`
3. If installed, verify: `fly status --app {app} 2>/dev/null`
4. Infer URL: `https://{app}.fly.dev`
5. Set deploy status command: `fly status --app {app}`
6. Set health check: `https://{app}.fly.dev` (or `/health` if the app has one)

Ask the user to confirm the production URL. Some Fly apps use custom domains.

#### Render

If `render.yaml` detected:

1. Extract service name and type from render.yaml
2. Check for Render API key: `echo $RENDER_API_KEY | head -c 4` (don't expose the full key)
3. Infer URL: `https://{service-name}.onrender.com`
4. Render deploys automatically on push to the connected branch — no deploy workflow needed
5. Set health check: the inferred URL

Ask the user to confirm. Render uses auto-deploy from the connected git branch — after
merge to main, Render picks it up automatically. The "deploy wait" in /land-and-deploy
should poll the Render URL until it responds with the new version.

#### Vercel

If vercel.json or .vercel detected:

1. Check for `vercel` CLI: `which vercel 2>/dev/null`
2. If installed: `vercel ls --prod 2>/dev/null | head -3`
3. Vercel deploys automatically on push — preview on PR, production on merge to main
4. Set health check: the production URL from vercel project settings

#### Netlify

If netlify.toml detected:

1. Extract site info from netlify.toml
2. Netlify deploys automatically on push
3. Set health check: the production URL

#### GitHub Actions only

If deploy workflows detected but no platform config:

1. Read the workflow file to understand what it does
2. Extract the deploy target (if mentioned)
3. Ask the user for the production URL

#### Custom / Manual

If nothing detected:

Use AskUserQuestion to gather the information:

1. **How are deploys triggered?**
   - A) Automatically on push to main (Fly, Render, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - B) Via GitHub Actions workflow
   - C) Via a deploy script or CLI command (describe it)
   - D) Manually (SSH, dashboard, etc.)
   - E) This project doesn't deploy (library, CLI, tool)

2. **What's the production URL?** (Free text — the URL where the app runs)

3. **How can gstack check if a deploy succeeded?**
   - A) HTTP health check at a specific URL (e.g., /health, /api/status)
   - B) CLI command (e.g., `fly status`, `kubectl rollout status`)
   - C) Check the GitHub Actions workflow status
   - D) No automated way — just check the URL loads

4. **Any pre-merge or post-merge hooks?**
   - Commands to run before merging (e.g., `bun run build`)
   - Commands to run after merge but before deploy verification

### Step 4: Write configuration

Read AGENTS.md (or create it). Find and replace the `## Deploy Configuration` section
if it exists, or append it at the end.

```markdown
## Deploy Configuration (configured by /setup-deploy)
- Platform: {platform}
- Production URL: {url}
- Deploy workflow: {workflow file or "auto-deploy on push"}
- Deploy status command: {command or "HTTP health check"}
- Merge method: {squash/merge/rebase}
- Project type: {web app / API / CLI / library}
- Post-deploy health check: {health check URL or command}

### Custom deploy hooks
- Pre-merge: {command or "none"}
- Deploy trigger: {command or "automatic on push to main"}
- Deploy status: {command or "poll production URL"}
- Health check: {URL or command}
```

### Step 5: Verify

After writing, verify the configuration works:

1. If a health check URL was configured, try it:
```bash
curl -sf "{health-check-url}" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" 2>/dev/null || echo "UNREACHABLE"
```

2. If a deploy status command was configured, try it:
```bash
{deploy-status-command} 2>/dev/null | head -5 || echo "COMMAND_FAILED"
```

Report results. If anything failed, note it but don't block — the config is still
useful even if the health check is temporarily unreachable.

### Step 6: Summary

```
DEPLOY CONFIGURATION — COMPLETE
════════════════════════════════
Platform:      {platform}
URL:           {url}
Health check:  {health check}
Status cmd:    {status command}
Merge method:  {merge method}

Saved to AGENTS.md. /land-and-deploy will use these settings automatically.

Next steps:
- Run /land-and-deploy to merge and deploy your current PR
- Edit the "## Deploy Configuration" section in AGENTS.md to change settings
- Run /setup-deploy again to reconfigure
```

## Important Rules

- **Never expose secrets.** Don't print full API keys, tokens, or passwords.
- **Confirm with the user.** Always show the detected config and ask for confirmation before writing.
- **AGENTS.md is the source of truth.** All configuration lives there — not in a separate config file.
- **Idempotent.** Running /setup-deploy multiple times overwrites the previous config cleanly.
- **Platform CLIs are optional.** If `fly` or `vercel` CLI isn't installed, fall back to URL-based health checks.
