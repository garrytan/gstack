# SKILL.md workflow

SKILL.md files are **generated** from `.tmpl` templates. To update docs:

1. Edit the `.tmpl` file (e.g. `SKILL.md.tmpl` or `browse/SKILL.md.tmpl`)
2. Run `bun run gen:skill-docs` (or `bun run build` which does it automatically)
3. Commit both the `.tmpl` and generated `.md` files

To add a new browse command: add it to `browse/src/commands.ts` and rebuild.
To add a snapshot flag: add it to `SNAPSHOT_FLAGS` in `browse/src/snapshot.ts` and rebuild.

**Token ceiling:** Generated SKILL.md files trip a warning above 160KB (~40K tokens).
This is a "watch for feature bloat" guardrail, not a hard gate. Modern flagship
models have 200K-1M context windows, so 40K is 4-20% of window, and prompt caching
makes the marginal cost of larger skills small. The ceiling exists to catch runaway
preamble/resolver growth, not to force compression on carefully-tuned big skills
(`ship`, `plan-ceo-review`, `office-hours` legitimately pack 25-35K tokens of
behavior). If you blow past 40K, the right fix is usually: (1) look at WHAT grew,
(2) if one resolver added 10K+ in a single PR, question whether it belongs inline
or as a reference doc, (3) only compress carefully-tuned prose as a last resort —
cuts to the coverage audit, review army, or voice directive have real quality cost.

**Merge conflicts on SKILL.md files:** NEVER resolve conflicts on generated SKILL.md
files by accepting either side. Instead: (1) resolve conflicts on the `.tmpl` templates
and `scripts/gen-skill-docs.ts` (the sources of truth), (2) run `bun run gen:skill-docs`
to regenerate all SKILL.md files, (3) stage the regenerated files. Accepting one side's
generated output silently drops the other side's template changes.

# Platform-agnostic design

Skills must NEVER hardcode framework-specific commands, file patterns, or directory
structures. Instead:

1. **Read CLAUDE.md** for project-specific config (test commands, eval commands, etc.)
2. **If missing, AskUserQuestion** — let the user tell you or let gstack search the repo
3. **Persist the answer to CLAUDE.md** so we never have to ask again

This applies to test commands, eval commands, deploy commands, and any other
project-specific behavior. The project owns its config; gstack reads it.

# Writing SKILL templates

SKILL.md.tmpl files are **prompt templates read by Claude**, not bash scripts.
Each bash code block runs in a separate shell — variables do not persist between blocks.

Rules:
- **Use natural language for logic and state.** Don't use shell variables to pass
  state between code blocks. Instead, tell Claude what to remember and reference
  it in prose (e.g., "the base branch detected in Step 0").
- **Don't hardcode branch names.** Detect `main`/`master`/etc dynamically via
  `gh pr view` or `gh repo view`. Use `{{BASE_BRANCH_DETECT}}` for PR-targeting
  skills. Use "the base branch" in prose, `<base>` in code block placeholders.
- **Keep bash blocks self-contained.** Each code block should work independently.
  If a block needs context from a previous step, restate it in the prose above.
- **Express conditionals as English.** Instead of nested `if/elif/else` in bash,
  write numbered decision steps: "1. If X, do Y. 2. Otherwise, do Z."

# Writing style (V1)

Default output from every tier-≥2 skill follows the Writing Style section in
`scripts/resolvers/preamble.ts`: jargon glossed on first use (curated list in
`scripts/jargon-list.json`, baked at gen-skill-docs time), questions framed in
outcome terms ("what breaks for your users if...") not implementation terms,
short sentences, decisions close with user impact. Power users who want the
tighter V0 prose set `gstack-config set explain_level terse` (binary switch,
no middle mode). See `docs/designs/PLAN_TUNING_V1.md` for the full design
rationale. The review pacing overhaul that originally tried to ride alongside
writing-style was extracted to V1.1 — see `docs/designs/PACING_UPDATES_V0.md`.
