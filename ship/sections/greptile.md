## Step 10: Address Greptile review comments (if PR exists)

**Dispatch the fetch + classification as a subagent** using the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`. The subagent pulls every Greptile comment, runs the escalation detection algorithm, and classifies each comment. Parent receives a structured list and handles user interaction + file edits.

**Subagent prompt:**

> You are classifying Greptile review comments for a /ship workflow. Read `.claude/skills/review/greptile-triage.md` and follow the fetch, filter, classify, and **escalation detection** steps. Do NOT fix code, do NOT reply to comments, do NOT commit — report only.
>
> For each comment, assign: `classification` (`valid_actionable`, `already_fixed`, `false_positive`, `suppressed`), `escalation_tier` (1 or 2), the file:line or [top-level] tag, body summary, and permalink URL.
>
> If no PR exists, `gh` fails, the API errors, or there are zero comments, output: `{"total":0,"comments":[]}` and stop.
>
> Otherwise, output a single JSON object on the LAST LINE of your response:
> `{"total":N,"comments":[{"classification":"...","escalation_tier":N,"ref":"file:line","summary":"...","permalink":"url"},...]}`

**Parent processing:**

Parse the LAST line as JSON.

If `total` is 0, skip this step silently. Continue to Step 12.

Otherwise, print: `+ {total} Greptile comments ({valid_actionable} valid, {already_fixed} already fixed, {false_positive} FP)`.

For each comment in `comments`:

**VALID & ACTIONABLE:** Use AskUserQuestion with:
- The comment (file:line or [top-level] + body summary + permalink URL)
- `RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because [one-line reason]`
- Options: A) Fix now, B) Acknowledge and ship anyway, C) It's a false positive
- If user chooses A: apply the fix, commit the fixed files (`git add <fixed-files> && git commit -m "fix: address Greptile review — <brief description>"`), reply using the **Fix reply template** from greptile-triage.md (include inline diff + explanation), and save to both per-project and global greptile-history (type: fix).
- If user chooses C: reply using the **False Positive reply template** from greptile-triage.md (include evidence + suggested re-rank), save to both per-project and global greptile-history (type: fp).

**VALID BUT ALREADY FIXED:** Reply using the **Already Fixed reply template** from greptile-triage.md — no AskUserQuestion needed:
- Include what was done and the fixing commit SHA
- Save to both per-project and global greptile-history (type: already-fixed)

**FALSE POSITIVE:** Use AskUserQuestion:
- Show the comment and why you think it's wrong (file:line or [top-level] + body summary + permalink URL)
- Options:
  - A) Reply to Greptile explaining the false positive (recommended if clearly wrong)
  - B) Fix it anyway (if trivial)
  - C) Ignore silently
- If user chooses A: reply using the **False Positive reply template** from greptile-triage.md (include evidence + suggested re-rank), save to both per-project and global greptile-history (type: fp)

**SUPPRESSED:** Skip silently — these are known false positives from previous triage.

**After all comments are resolved:** If any fixes were applied, the tests from Step 5 are now stale. **Re-run tests** (Step 5) before continuing to Step 12. If no fixes were applied, continue to Step 12.
