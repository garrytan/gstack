# Changelog

## 0.4.2 — 2026-03-16

- **`$B js "await fetch(...)"` now just works.** Any `await` expression in `$B js` or `$B eval` is automatically wrapped in an async context. No more `SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions`. Single-line eval files return values directly; multi-line files use explicit `return`.
- **Contributor mode now reflects, not just reacts.** Instead of only filing reports when something breaks, contributor mode now prompts periodic reflection: "Rate your gstack experience 0-10. Not a 10? Think about why." Catches quality-of-life issues and friction that passive detection misses. Reports now include a 0-10 rating and "What would make this a 10" to focus on actionable improvements.

### For contributors

- Added `hasAwait()` helper with comment-stripping to avoid false positives on `// await` in eval files.
- Smart eval wrapping: single-line → expression `(...)`, multi-line → block `{...}` with explicit `return`.
- 6 new async wrapping unit tests, 40 new contributor mode preamble validation tests.
- Calibration example framed as historical ("used to fail") to avoid implying a live bug post-fix.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-03-16

- **gstack now notices when it screws up.** Turn on contributor mode (`gstack-config set gstack_contributor true`) and gstack automatically writes up what went wrong — what you were doing, what broke, repro steps. Next time something annoys you, the bug report is already written. Fork gstack and fix it yourself.
- **Juggling multiple sessions? gstack keeps up.** When you have 3+ gstack windows open, every question now tells you which project, which branch, and what you were working on. No more staring at a question thinking "wait, which window is this?"
- **Every question now comes with a recommendation.** Instead of dumping options on you and making you think, gstack tells you what it would pick and why. Same clear format across every skill.
- **/review now catches forgotten enum handlers.** Add a new status, tier, or type constant? /review traces it through every switch statement, allowlist, and filter in your codebase — not just the files you changed. Catches the "added the value but forgot to handle it" class of bugs before they ship.

### For contributors

- Renamed `{{UPDATE_CHECK}}` to `{{PREAMBLE}}` across all 11 skill templates — one startup block now handles update check, session tracking, contributor mode, and question formatting.
- DRY'd plan-ceo-review and plan-eng-review question formatting to reference the preamble baseline instead of duplicating rules.
- Added CHANGELOG style guide and vendored symlink awareness docs to CLAUDE.md.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-03-16

### Added
- **QA-only skill** (`/qa-only`) — report-only QA mode that finds and documents bugs without making fixes. Hand off a clean bug report to your team without the agent touching your code.
- **QA fix loop** — `/qa` now runs a find-fix-verify cycle: discover bugs, fix them, commit, re-navigate to confirm the fix took. One command to go from broken to shipped.
- **Plan-to-QA artifact flow** — `/plan-eng-review` writes test-plan artifacts that `/qa` picks up automatically. Your engineering review now feeds directly into QA testing with no manual copy-paste.
- **`{{QA_METHODOLOGY}}` DRY placeholder** — shared QA methodology block injected into both `/qa` and `/qa-only` templates. Keeps both skills in sync when you update testing standards.
- **Eval efficiency metrics** — turns, duration, and cost now displayed across all eval surfaces with natural-language **Takeaway** commentary. See at a glance whether your prompt changes made the agent faster or slower.
- **`generateCommentary()` engine** — interprets comparison deltas so you don't have to: flags regressions, notes improvements, and produces an overall efficiency summary.
- **Eval list columns** — `bun run eval:list` now shows Turns and Duration per run. Spot expensive or slow runs instantly.
- **Eval summary per-test efficiency** — `bun run eval:summary` shows average turns/duration/cost per test across runs. Identify which tests are costing you the most over time.
- **`judgePassed()` unit tests** — extracted and tested the pass/fail judgment logic.
- **3 new E2E tests** — qa-only no-fix guardrail, qa fix loop with commit verification, plan-eng-review test-plan artifact.
- **Browser ref staleness detection** — `resolveRef()` now checks element count to detect stale refs after page mutations. SPA navigation no longer causes 30-second timeouts on missing elements.
- 3 new snapshot tests for ref staleness.

### Changed
- QA skill prompt restructured with explicit two-cycle workflow (find → fix → verify).
- `formatComparison()` now shows per-test turns and duration deltas alongside cost.
- `printSummary()` shows turns and duration columns.
- `eval-store.test.ts` fixed pre-existing `_partial` file assertion bug.

### Fixed
- Browser ref staleness — refs collected before page mutation (e.g. SPA navigation) are now detected and re-collected. Eliminates a class of flaky QA failures on dynamic sites.

## 0.3.10 — 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Team sync via Supabase (optional)** — shared data store for eval results, retro snapshots, QA reports, ship logs, and Greptile triage across team members. All sync operations are non-fatal and non-blocking — skills never wait on network. Offline queue with automatic retry (up to 5 attempts). Zero impact when not configured: without `.gstack-sync.json`, everything works locally as before. See `docs/designs/TEAM_COORDINATION_STORE.md` for architecture and setup.
- **Supabase migration SQL** — 4 migration files in `supabase/migrations/` for teams, eval_runs, data tables (retros, QA, ships, Greptile), and eval costs. Row-level security policies ensure team members can only access their own team's data.
- **Sync config + auth** — `.gstack-sync.json` for project-level config (Supabase URL, anon key, team slug). `~/.gstack/auth.json` for user-level tokens (keyed by Supabase URL for multi-team support). `GSTACK_SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var for CI/automation. Token refresh built in.
- **`gstack sync` CLI** — `status`, `push`, `pull`, `drain`, `login`, `logout` subcommands for managing team sync.
- **Universal eval format** — `StandardEvalResult` schema with validation, normalization, and bidirectional legacy conversion. Any language can produce JSON matching this format and push via `gstack eval push`.
- **Unified eval CLI** — `gstack eval list|compare|summary|trend|push|cost|cache|watch` consolidating all eval tools into one entry point.
- **Per-model cost tracking** — eval results now include `costs[]` with exact per-model token usage (input, output, cache read, cache creation) and API-reported cost. Extracted from `resultLine.modelUsage` in the `claude -p` NDJSON stream. `computeCosts()` prefers exact `cost_usd` over MODEL_PRICING estimates (~4x more accurate with prompt caching).
- **LLM judge caching** — SHA-based caching for LLM-as-judge eval calls via `eval-cache.ts`. Cache keyed by `model:prompt`, so unchanged SKILL.md content skips API calls entirely. ~$0.18/run savings. Set `EVAL_CACHE=0` to force re-run.
- **Dynamic model selection** — `EVAL_JUDGE_TIER` env var controls which Claude model runs judge evals (haiku/sonnet/opus, default: sonnet). `EVAL_TIER` pins the E2E test model via `--model` flag to `claude -p`.
- **`bun run eval:trend`** — per-test pass rate tracking over last N runs. Classifies tests as stable-pass, stable-fail, flaky, improving, or degrading. Sparkline table with `--limit`, `--tier`, `--test` filters.
- **Shared utilities** — `lib/util.ts` extracted with `atomicWriteJSON`, `readJSON`, `getGitInfo`, `getRemoteSlug`, `listEvalFiles`, `loadEvalResults`, `formatTimestamp`, and path constants.
- 52+ new tests across eval cache, cost, format, tier, trend, sync config, sync client, and LLM judge integration.

### Changed
- `callJudge()` and `judge()` now return `{ result, meta }` with `JudgeMeta` (model, tokens, cached flag). `outcomeJudge()` retains simple return type for E2E callers.
- `EvalCollector.finalize()` aggregates per-test `costs[]` into result-level cost breakdown and attempts team sync (non-blocking).
- `cli-eval.ts` main block guarded with `import.meta.main` to prevent execution on import.
- `eval:summary` now hints to run `eval:trend` when flaky tests are detected.
- All 8 LLM eval test sites updated from hard-coded `cost_usd: 0.02` to real API-reported costs.

## 0.3.9 — 2026-03-15

### Added
- **`bin/gstack-config` CLI** — simple get/set/list interface for `~/.gstack/config.yaml`. Used by update-check and upgrade skill for persistent settings (auto_upgrade, update_check).
- **Smart update check** — 12h cache TTL (was 24h), exponential snooze backoff (24h → 48h → 1 week) when user declines upgrades, `update_check: false` config option to disable checks entirely. Snooze resets when a new version is released.
- **Auto-upgrade mode** — set `auto_upgrade: true` in config or `GSTACK_AUTO_UPGRADE=1` env var to skip the upgrade prompt and update automatically.
- **4-option upgrade prompt** — "Yes, upgrade now", "Always keep me up to date", "Not now" (snooze), "Never ask again" (disable).
- **Vendored copy sync** — `/gstack-upgrade` now detects and updates local vendored copies in the current project after upgrading the primary install.
- 25 new tests: 11 for gstack-config CLI, 14 for snooze/config paths in update-check.

### Changed
- README upgrade/troubleshooting sections simplified to reference `/gstack-upgrade` instead of long paste commands.
- Upgrade skill template bumped to v1.1.0 with `Write` tool permission for config editing.
- All SKILL.md preambles updated with new upgrade flow description.

## 0.3.8 — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **TODOS.md as single source of truth** — merged `TODO.md` (roadmap) and `TODOS.md` (near-term) into one file organized by skill/component with P0-P4 priority ordering and a Completed section.
- **`/ship` Step 5.5: TODOS.md management** — auto-detects completed items from the diff, marks them done with version annotations, offers to create/reorganize TODOS.md if missing or unstructured.
- **Cross-skill TODOS awareness** — `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/retro`, `/review`, and `/qa` now read TODOS.md for project context. `/retro` adds Backlog Health metric (open counts, P0/P1 items, churn).
- **Shared `review/TODOS-format.md`** — canonical TODO item format referenced by `/ship` and `/plan-ceo-review` to prevent format drift (DRY).
- **Greptile 2-tier reply system** — Tier 1 (friendly, inline diff + explanation) for first responses; Tier 2 (firm, full evidence chain + re-rank request) when Greptile re-flags after a prior reply.
- **Greptile reply templates** — structured templates in `greptile-triage.md` for fixes (inline diff), already-fixed (what was done), and false positives (evidence + suggested re-rank). Replaces vague one-line replies.
- **Greptile escalation detection** — explicit algorithm to detect prior GStack replies on comment threads and auto-escalate to Tier 2.
- **Greptile severity re-ranking** — replies now include `**Suggested re-rank:**` when Greptile miscategorizes issue severity.
- Static validation tests for `TODOS-format.md` references across skills.

### Fixed
- **`.gitignore` append failures silently swallowed** — `ensureStateDir()` bare `catch {}` replaced with ENOENT-only silence; non-ENOENT errors (EACCES, ENOSPC) logged to `.gstack/browse-server.log`.

### Changed
- `TODO.md` deleted — all items merged into `TODOS.md`.
- `/ship` Step 3.75 and `/review` Step 5 now reference reply templates and escalation detection from `greptile-triage.md`.
- `/ship` Step 6 commit ordering includes TODOS.md in the final commit alongside VERSION + CHANGELOG.
- `/ship` Step 8 PR body includes TODOS section.

## 0.3.7 — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Screenshot element/region clipping** — `screenshot` command now supports element crop via CSS selector or @ref (`screenshot "#hero" out.png`, `screenshot @e3 out.png`), region clip (`screenshot --clip x,y,w,h out.png`), and viewport-only mode (`screenshot --viewport out.png`). Uses Playwright's native `locator.screenshot()` and `page.screenshot({ clip })`. Full page remains the default.
- 10 new tests covering all screenshot modes (viewport, CSS, @ref, clip) and error paths (unknown flag, mutual exclusion, invalid coords, path validation, nonexistent selector).

## 0.3.6 — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **E2E observability** — heartbeat file (`~/.gstack-dev/e2e-live.json`), per-run log directory (`~/.gstack-dev/e2e-runs/{runId}/`), progress.log, per-test NDJSON transcripts, persistent failure transcripts. All I/O non-fatal.
- **`bun run eval:watch`** — live terminal dashboard reads heartbeat + partial eval file every 1s. Shows completed tests, current test with turn/tool info, stale detection (>10min), `--tail` for progress.log.
- **Incremental eval saves** — `savePartial()` writes `_partial-e2e.json` after each test completes. Crash-resilient: partial results survive killed runs. Never cleaned up.
- **Machine-readable diagnostics** — `exit_reason`, `timeout_at_turn`, `last_tool_call` fields in eval JSON. Enables `jq` queries for automated fix loops.
- **API connectivity pre-check** — E2E suite throws immediately on ConnectionRefused before burning test budget.
- **`is_error` detection** — `claude -p` can return `subtype: "success"` with `is_error: true` on API failures. Now correctly classified as `error_api`.
- **Stream-json NDJSON parser** — `parseNDJSON()` pure function for real-time E2E progress from `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose`.
- **Eval persistence** — results saved to `~/.gstack-dev/evals/` with auto-comparison against previous run.
- **Eval CLI tools** — `eval:list`, `eval:compare`, `eval:summary` for inspecting eval history.
- **All 9 skills converted to `.tmpl` templates** — plan-ceo-review, plan-eng-review, retro, review, ship now use `{{UPDATE_CHECK}}` placeholder. Single source of truth for update check preamble.
- **3-tier eval suite** — Tier 1: static validation (free), Tier 2: E2E via `claude -p` (~$3.85/run), Tier 3: LLM-as-judge (~$0.15/run). Gated by `EVALS=1`.
- **Planted-bug outcome testing** — eval fixtures with known bugs, LLM judge scores detection.
- 15 observability unit tests covering heartbeat schema, progress.log format, NDJSON naming, savePartial, finalize, watcher rendering, stale detection, non-fatal I/O.
- E2E tests for plan-ceo-review, plan-eng-review, retro skills.
- Update-check exit code regression tests.
- `test/helpers/skill-parser.ts` — `getRemoteSlug()` for git remote detection.

### Fixed
- **Browse binary discovery broken for agents** — replaced `find-browse` indirection with explicit `browse/dist/browse` path in SKILL.md setup blocks.
- **Update check exit code 1 misleading agents** — added `|| true` to prevent non-zero exit when no update available.
- **browse/SKILL.md missing setup block** — added `{{BROWSE_SETUP}}` placeholder.
- **plan-ceo-review timeout** — init git repo in test dir, skip codebase exploration, bump timeout to 420s.
- Planted-bug eval reliability — simplified prompts, lowered detection baselines, resilient to max_turns flakes.

### Changed
- **Template system expanded** — `{{UPDATE_CHECK}}` and `{{BROWSE_SETUP}}` placeholders in `gen-skill-docs.ts`. All browse-using skills generate from single source of truth.
- Enriched 14 command descriptions with specific arg formats, valid values, error behavior, and return types.
- Setup block checks workspace-local path first (for development), falls back to global install.
- LLM eval judge upgraded from Haiku to Sonnet 4.6.
- `generateHelpText()` auto-generated from COMMAND_DESCRIPTIONS (replaces hand-maintained help text).

## 0.3.3 — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **SKILL.md template system** — `.tmpl` files with `{{COMMAND_REFERENCE}}` and `{{SNAPSHOT_FLAGS}}` placeholders, auto-generated from source code at build time. Structurally prevents command drift between docs and code.
- **Command registry** (`browse/src/commands.ts`) — single source of truth for all browse commands with categories and enriched descriptions. Zero side effects, safe to import from build scripts and tests.
- **Snapshot flags metadata** (`SNAPSHOT_FLAGS` array in `browse/src/snapshot.ts`) — metadata-driven parser replaces hand-coded switch/case. Adding a flag in one place updates the parser, docs, and tests.
- **Tier 1 static validation** — 43 tests: parses `$B` commands from SKILL.md code blocks, validates against command registry and snapshot flag metadata
- **Tier 2 E2E tests** via Agent SDK — spawns real Claude sessions, runs skills, scans for browse errors. Gated by `SKILL_E2E=1` env var (~$0.50/run)
- **Tier 3 LLM-as-judge evals** — Haiku scores generated docs on clarity/completeness/actionability (threshold ≥4/5), plus regression test vs hand-maintained baseline. Gated by `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **`bun run skill:check`** — health dashboard showing all skills, command counts, validation status, template freshness
- **`bun run dev:skill`** — watch mode that regenerates and validates SKILL.md on every template or source file change
- **CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/skill-docs.yml`) — runs `gen:skill-docs` on push/PR, fails if generated output differs from committed files
- `bun run gen:skill-docs` script for manual regeneration
- `bun run test:eval` for LLM-as-judge evals
- `test/helpers/skill-parser.ts` — extracts and validates `$B` commands from Markdown
- `test/helpers/session-runner.ts` — Agent SDK wrapper with error pattern scanning and transcript saving
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — design decisions document covering daemon model, security, ref system, logging, crash recovery
- **Conductor integration** (`conductor.json`) — lifecycle hooks for workspace setup/teardown
- **`.env` propagation** — `bin/dev-setup` copies `.env` from main worktree into Conductor workspaces automatically
- `.env.example` template for API key configuration

### Changed
- Build now runs `gen:skill-docs` before compiling binaries
- `parseSnapshotArgs` is metadata-driven (iterates `SNAPSHOT_FLAGS` instead of switch/case)
- `server.ts` imports command sets from `commands.ts` instead of declaring inline
- SKILL.md and browse/SKILL.md are now generated files (edit the `.tmpl` instead)

## 0.3.2 — 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- Cookie import picker now returns JSON instead of HTML — `jsonResponse()` referenced `url` out of scope, crashing every API call
- `help` command routed correctly (was unreachable due to META_COMMANDS dispatch ordering)
- Stale servers from global install no longer shadow local changes — removed legacy `~/.claude/skills/gstack` fallback from `resolveServerScript()`
- Crash log path references updated from `/tmp/` to `.gstack/`

### Added
- **Diff-aware QA mode** — `/qa` on a feature branch auto-analyzes `git diff`, identifies affected pages/routes, detects the running app on localhost, and tests only what changed. No URL needed.
- **Project-local browse state** — state file, logs, and all server state now live in `.gstack/` inside the project root (detected via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`). No more `/tmp` state files.
- **Shared config module** (`browse/src/config.ts`) — centralizes path resolution for CLI and server, eliminates duplicated port/state logic
- **Random port selection** — server picks a random port 10000-60000 instead of scanning 9400-9409. No more CONDUCTOR_PORT magic offset. No more port collisions across workspaces.
- **Binary version tracking** — state file includes `binaryVersion` SHA; CLI auto-restarts the server when the binary is rebuilt
- **Legacy /tmp cleanup** — CLI scans for and removes old `/tmp/browse-server*.json` files, verifying PID ownership before sending signals
- **Greptile integration** — `/review` and `/ship` fetch and triage Greptile bot comments; `/retro` tracks Greptile batting average across weeks
- **Local dev mode** — `bin/dev-setup` symlinks skills from the repo for in-place development; `bin/dev-teardown` restores global install
- `help` command — agents can self-discover all commands and snapshot flags
- Version-aware `find-browse` with META signal protocol — detects stale binaries and prompts agents to update
- `browse/dist/find-browse` compiled binary with git SHA comparison against origin/main (4hr cached)
- `.version` file written at build time for binary version tracking
- Route-level tests for cookie picker (13 tests) and find-browse version check (10 tests)
- Config resolution tests (14 tests) covering git root detection, BROWSE_STATE_FILE override, ensureStateDir, readVersionHash, resolveServerScript, and version mismatch detection
- Browser interaction guidance in CLAUDE.md — prevents Claude from using mcp\_\_claude-in-chrome\_\_\* tools
- CONTRIBUTING.md with quick start, dev mode explanation, and instructions for testing branches in other repos

### Changed
- State file location: `.gstack/browse.json` (was `/tmp/browse-server.json`)
- Log files location: `.gstack/browse-{console,network,dialog}.log` (was `/tmp/browse-*.log`)
- Atomic state file writes: `.json.tmp` → rename (prevents partial reads)
- CLI passes `BROWSE_STATE_FILE` to spawned server (server derives all paths from it)
- SKILL.md setup checks parse META signals and handle `META:UPDATE_AVAILABLE`
- `/qa` SKILL.md now describes four modes (diff-aware, full, quick, regression) with diff-aware as the default on feature branches
- `jsonResponse`/`errorResponse` use options objects to prevent positional parameter confusion
- Build script compiles both `browse` and `find-browse` binaries, cleans up `.bun-build` temp files
- README updated with Greptile setup instructions, diff-aware QA examples, and revised demo transcript

### Removed
- `CONDUCTOR_PORT` magic offset (`browse_port = CONDUCTOR_PORT - 45600`)
- Port scan range 9400-9409
- Legacy fallback to `~/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/src/server.ts`
- `DEVELOPING_GSTACK.md` (renamed to CONTRIBUTING.md)

## 0.3.1 — 2026-03-12

### Phase 3.5: Browser cookie import

- `cookie-import-browser` command — decrypt and import cookies from real Chromium browsers (Comet, Chrome, Arc, Brave, Edge)
- Interactive cookie picker web UI served from the browse server (dark theme, two-panel layout, domain search, import/remove)
- Direct CLI import with `--domain` flag for non-interactive use
- `/setup-browser-cookies` skill for Claude Code integration
- macOS Keychain access with async 10s timeout (no event loop blocking)
- Per-browser AES key caching (one Keychain prompt per browser per session)
- DB lock fallback: copies locked cookie DB to /tmp for safe reads
- 18 unit tests with encrypted cookie fixtures

## 0.3.0 — 2026-03-12

### Phase 3: /qa skill — systematic QA testing

- New `/qa` skill with 6-phase workflow (Initialize, Authenticate, Orient, Explore, Document, Wrap up)
- Three modes: full (systematic, 5-10 issues), quick (30-second smoke test), regression (compare against baseline)
- Issue taxonomy: 7 categories, 4 severity levels, per-page exploration checklist
- Structured report template with health score (0-100, weighted across 7 categories)
- Framework detection guidance for Next.js, Rails, WordPress, and SPAs
- `browse/bin/find-browse` — DRY binary discovery using `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`

### Phase 2: Enhanced browser

- Dialog handling: auto-accept/dismiss, dialog buffer, prompt text support
- File upload: `upload <sel> <file1> [file2...]`
- Element state checks: `is visible|hidden|enabled|disabled|checked|editable|focused <sel>`
- Annotated screenshots with ref labels overlaid (`snapshot -a`)
- Snapshot diffing against previous snapshot (`snapshot -D`)
- Cursor-interactive element scan for non-ARIA clickables (`snapshot -C`)
- `wait --networkidle` / `--load` / `--domcontentloaded` flags
- `console --errors` filter (error + warning only)
- `cookie-import <json-file>` with auto-fill domain from page URL
- CircularBuffer O(1) ring buffer for console/network/dialog buffers
- Async buffer flush with Bun.write()
- Health check with page.evaluate + 2s timeout
- Playwright error wrapping — actionable messages for AI agents
- Context recreation preserves cookies/storage/URLs (useragent fix)
- SKILL.md rewritten as QA-oriented playbook with 10 workflow patterns
- 166 integration tests (was ~63)

## 0.0.2 — 2026-03-12

- Fix project-local `/browse` installs — compiled binary now resolves `server.ts` from its own directory instead of assuming a global install exists
- `setup` rebuilds stale binaries (not just missing ones) and exits non-zero if the build fails
- Fix `chain` command swallowing real errors from write commands (e.g. navigation timeout reported as "Unknown meta command")
- Fix unbounded restart loop in CLI when server crashes repeatedly on the same command
- Cap console/network buffers at 50k entries (ring buffer) instead of growing without bound
- Fix disk flush stopping silently after buffer hits the 50k cap
- Fix `ln -snf` in setup to avoid creating nested symlinks on upgrade
- Use `git fetch && git reset --hard` instead of `git pull` for upgrades (handles force-pushes)
- Simplify install: global-first with optional project copy (replaces submodule approach)
- Restructured README: hero, before/after, demo transcript, troubleshooting section
- Six skills (added `/retro`)

## 0.0.1 — 2026-03-11

Initial release.

- Five skills: `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/review`, `/ship`, `/browse`
- Headless browser CLI with 40+ commands, ref-based interaction, persistent Chromium daemon
- One-command install as Claude Code skills (submodule or global clone)
- `setup` script for binary compilation and skill symlinking
