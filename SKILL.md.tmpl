{{PREAMBLE}}

If `PROACTIVE` is `false`: do NOT proactively invoke or suggest other gstack skills during
this session. Only run skills the user explicitly invokes. This preference persists across
sessions via `gstack-config`.

If `PROACTIVE` is `true` (default): **invoke the Skill tool** when the user's request
matches a skill's purpose. Do NOT answer directly when a skill exists for the task.
Use the Skill tool to invoke it. The skill has specialized workflows, checklists, and
quality gates that produce better results than answering inline.

**Routing rules — when you see these patterns, INVOKE the skill via the Skill tool:**
- User describes a new idea, asks "is this worth building", wants to brainstorm → invoke `/office-hours`
- User asks about strategy, scope, ambition, "think bigger" → invoke `/plan-ceo-review`
- User asks to review architecture, lock in the plan → invoke `/plan-eng-review`
- User asks about design system, brand, visual identity → invoke `/design-consultation`
- User asks to review design of a plan → invoke `/plan-design-review`
- User wants all reviews done automatically → invoke `/autoplan`
- User reports a bug, error, broken behavior, asks "why is this broken" → invoke `/investigate`
- User asks to test the site, find bugs, QA → invoke `/qa`
- User asks to review code, check the diff, pre-landing review → invoke `/review`
- User asks about visual polish, design audit of a live site → invoke `/design-review`
- User asks to ship, deploy, push, create a PR → invoke `/ship`
- User asks to update docs after shipping → invoke `/document-release`
- User asks for a weekly retro, what did we ship → invoke `/retro`
- User asks for a second opinion, codex review → invoke `/codex`
- User asks for safety mode, careful mode → invoke `/careful` or `/guard`
- User asks to restrict edits to a directory → invoke `/freeze` or `/unfreeze`
- User asks to upgrade gstack → invoke `/gstack-upgrade`

**Do NOT answer the user's question directly when a matching skill exists.** The skill
provides a structured, multi-step workflow that is always better than an ad-hoc answer.
Invoke the skill first. If no skill matches, answer directly as usual.

If the user opts out of suggestions, run `gstack-config set proactive false`.
If they opt back in, run `gstack-config set proactive true`.

# gstack browse: QA Testing & Dogfooding

Persistent headless Chromium. First call auto-starts (~3s), then ~100-200ms per command.
Auto-shuts down after 30 min idle. State persists between calls (cookies, tabs, sessions).

{{BROWSE_SETUP}}

## IMPORTANT

- Use the compiled binary via Bash: `$B <command>`
- NEVER use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools. They are slow and unreliable.
- Browser persists between calls — cookies, login sessions, and tabs carry over.
- Dialogs (alert/confirm/prompt) are auto-accepted by default — no browser lockup.
- **Show screenshots:** After `$B screenshot`, `$B snapshot -a -o`, or `$B responsive`, always use the Read tool on the output PNG(s) so the user can see them. Without this, screenshots are invisible.

## QA Workflows

> **Credential safety:** Use environment variables for test credentials.
> Set them before running: `export TEST_EMAIL="..." TEST_PASSWORD="..."`

### Test a user flow (login, signup, checkout, etc.)

```bash
# 1. Go to the page
$B goto https://app.example.com/login

# 2. See what's interactive
$B snapshot -i

# 3. Fill the form using refs
$B fill @e3 "$TEST_EMAIL"
$B fill @e4 "$TEST_PASSWORD"
$B click @e5

# 4. Verify it worked
$B snapshot -D              # diff shows what changed after clicking
$B is visible ".dashboard"  # assert the dashboard appeared
$B screenshot /tmp/after-login.png
```

### Verify a deployment / check prod

```bash
$B goto https://yourapp.com
$B text                          # read the page — does it load?
$B console                       # any JS errors?
$B network                       # any failed requests?
$B js "document.title"           # correct title?
$B is visible ".hero-section"    # key elements present?
$B screenshot /tmp/prod-check.png
```

### Dogfood a feature end-to-end

```bash
# Navigate to the feature
$B goto https://app.example.com/new-feature

# Take annotated screenshot — shows every interactive element with labels
$B snapshot -i -a -o /tmp/feature-annotated.png

# Find ALL clickable things (including divs with cursor:pointer)
$B snapshot -C

# Walk through the flow
$B snapshot -i          # baseline
$B click @e3            # interact
$B snapshot -D          # what changed? (unified diff)

# Check element states
$B is visible ".success-toast"
$B is enabled "#next-step-btn"
$B is checked "#agree-checkbox"

# Check console for errors after interactions
$B console
```

### Test responsive layouts

```bash
# Quick: 3 screenshots at mobile/tablet/desktop
$B goto https://yourapp.com
$B responsive /tmp/layout

# Manual: specific viewport
$B viewport 375x812     # iPhone
$B screenshot /tmp/mobile.png
$B viewport 1440x900    # Desktop
$B screenshot /tmp/desktop.png

# Element screenshot (crop to specific element)
$B screenshot "#hero-banner" /tmp/hero.png
$B snapshot -i
$B screenshot @e3 /tmp/button.png

# Region crop
$B screenshot --clip 0,0,800,600 /tmp/above-fold.png

# Viewport only (no scroll)
$B screenshot --viewport /tmp/viewport.png
```

### Test file upload

```bash
$B goto https://app.example.com/upload
$B snapshot -i
$B upload @e3 /path/to/test-file.pdf
$B is visible ".upload-success"
$B screenshot /tmp/upload-result.png
```

### Test forms with validation

```bash
$B goto https://app.example.com/form
$B snapshot -i

# Submit empty — check validation errors appear
$B click @e10                        # submit button
$B snapshot -D                       # diff shows error messages appeared
$B is visible ".error-message"

# Fill and resubmit
$B fill @e3 "valid input"
$B click @e10
$B snapshot -D                       # diff shows errors gone, success state
```

### Test dialogs (delete confirmations, prompts)

```bash
# Set up dialog handling BEFORE triggering
$B dialog-accept              # will auto-accept next alert/confirm
$B click "#delete-button"     # triggers confirmation dialog
$B dialog                     # see what dialog appeared
$B snapshot -D                # verify the item was deleted

# For prompts that need input
$B dialog-accept "my answer"  # accept with text
$B click "#rename-button"     # triggers prompt
```

### Test authenticated pages (import real browser cookies)

```bash
# Import cookies from your real browser (opens interactive picker)
$B cookie-import-browser

# Or import a specific domain directly
$B cookie-import-browser comet --domain .github.com

# Now test authenticated pages
$B goto https://github.com/settings/profile
$B snapshot -i
$B screenshot /tmp/github-profile.png
```

> **Cookie safety:** `cookie-import-browser` transfers real session data.
> Only import cookies from browsers you control.

### Compare two pages / environments

```bash
$B diff https://staging.app.com https://prod.app.com
```

### Multi-step chain (efficient for long flows)

```bash
echo '[
  ["goto","https://app.example.com"],
  ["snapshot","-i"],
  ["fill","@e3","$TEST_EMAIL"],
  ["fill","@e4","$TEST_PASSWORD"],
  ["click","@e5"],
  ["snapshot","-D"],
  ["screenshot","/tmp/result.png"]
]' | $B chain
```

## Quick Assertion Patterns

```bash
# Element exists and is visible
$B is visible ".modal"

# Button is enabled/disabled
$B is enabled "#submit-btn"
$B is disabled "#submit-btn"

# Checkbox state
$B is checked "#agree"

# Input is editable
$B is editable "#name-field"

# Element has focus
$B is focused "#search-input"

# Page contains text
$B js "document.body.textContent.includes('Success')"

# Element count
$B js "document.querySelectorAll('.list-item').length"

# Specific attribute value
$B attrs "#logo"    # returns all attributes as JSON

# CSS property
$B css ".button" "background-color"
```

## Tips

1. **Navigate once, query many times.** `goto` loads the page; then `text`, `js`, `screenshot` all hit the loaded page instantly.
2. **Use `snapshot -i` first.** See all interactive elements, then click/fill by ref. No CSS selector guessing.
3. **Use `snapshot -D` to verify.** Baseline → action → diff. See exactly what changed.
4. **Use `is` for assertions.** `is visible .modal` is faster and more reliable than parsing page text.
5. **Use `snapshot -a` for evidence.** Annotated screenshots are great for bug reports.
6. **Use `snapshot -C` for tricky UIs.** Finds clickable divs that the accessibility tree misses.
7. **Check `console` after actions.** Catch JS errors that don't surface visually.
8. **Use `chain` for long flows.** Single command, no per-step CLI overhead.
