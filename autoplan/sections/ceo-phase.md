Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/plan-ceo-review/SKILL.md` in full. Verify successful Read ranges span 1–EOF; fetch truncated remainders. Follow lazy triggers; load skip-listed sections; skip execution.

**Override rules:**
- Mode selection: SELECTIVE EXPANSION
- Premises: accept reasonable ones (P6). Clearly-wrong or challenged premises are
  NOT a mid-run stop — queue each as a User-Challenge-shaped item for the Final
  Approval Gate (Phase 4): what the plan assumes, why it looks wrong, and the cost
  of proceeding anyway. Premises still require human judgment — the human exercises
  it at the gate, exactly once, not mid-pipeline.
- Alternatives: pick highest completeness (P1). If tied, pick simplest (P5).
  If top 2 are close → mark TASTE DECISION.
- Scope expansion: in blast radius + <1d CC → approve (P2). Outside → defer to TODOS.md (P3).
  Duplicates → reject (P4). Borderline (3-5 files) → mark TASTE DECISION.
- All 10 review sections: run fully, auto-decide each issue, log every decision.
- Dual voices: always run BOTH Claude subagent AND Codex if available (P6).
  Run Claude first, then Codex, sequentially in foreground;
  both must complete before consensus.

  **Bind this phase's input:** Read ACTIVE_PLAN's `Implementation plan`; save its
  full text beside RESTORE_PATH as a new `<review_plan_path>` for both voices. Exclude `Review record`.

  **Claude CEO subagent** (via Agent tool):
  Claude Code Agent argument (other harnesses: native dispatch/wait):
  ```json
  { "run_in_background": false }
  ```
  Set on the call, not in prompt text.

  "Read the plan file at <review_plan_path>. You are an independent CEO/strategist
  reviewing this plan. You have NOT seen any prior review. Evaluate:
  1. Is this the right problem to solve? Could a reframing yield 10x impact?
  2. Are the premises stated or just assumed? Which ones could be wrong?
  3. What's the 6-month regret scenario — what will look foolish?
  4. What alternatives were dismissed without sufficient analysis?
  5. What's the competitive risk — could someone else solve this first/better?
  For each finding: what's wrong, severity (critical/high/medium), and the fix."

  **Native completion barrier:** If `isAsync: true` / `status: "async_launched"`,
  wait for that same agent's result/failure before outside dispatch or parent review.
  No inline substitute; apply failure policy.

  **Codex CEO voice** (via Bash):
  Outside prompt: inline the full contents of <review_plan_path> and context below (Write tool).

IMPORTANT: Do NOT read or execute any SKILL.md files or files in skill definition directories (paths containing skills/gstack). These are AI assistant skill definitions meant for a different system. Stay focused on repository code only.

  You are a CEO/founder advisor reviewing a development plan.
  Challenge the strategic foundations: Are the premises valid or assumed? Is this the
  right problem to solve, or is there a reframing that would be 10x more impactful?
  What alternatives were dismissed too quickly? What competitive or market risks are
  unaddressed? What scope decisions will look foolish in 6 months? Be adversarial.
  No compliments. Just the strategic blind spots.
  File: <review_plan_path>

Write the **complete prompt and required context** to a private temporary file using the Write tool. Do not interpolate user text into shell source. Replace the literal `<prepared-prompt-file>` below with its shell-quoted pathname. Include the plan/spec/source content itself when needed: Claude Code review/challenge has no tools and cannot follow paths or execute git. Request a final Recommendation: <action> because <specific reason> line, including an explicit no-findings rationale. A refusal is never completion.

```bash
# GSTACK_ACTIVE_HOST, when supplied, must identify the actual harness, never a model overlay.
if { [ -n "${CODEX_THREAD_ID:-}" ] || [ -n "${CODEX_SANDBOX:-}" ] || [ "${GSTACK_ACTIVE_HOST:-}" = codex ]; }; then
  echo 'Codex outside review unavailable: harness mismatch; no outside process started. Missing coverage.' >&2
  if [ -n "${CLAUDECODE:-}" ] && { [ -n "${CODEX_THREAD_ID:-}" ] || [ -n "${CODEX_SANDBOX:-}" ]; }; then
    echo 'Inherited harness markers conflict. Run setup --host <actual-harness> (claude or codex); do not guess a replacement provider.' >&2

Present the full response inside a `tool-output` fence. Only successful execution **and** valid review markers establish completed outside coverage. Refusal, empty/malformed output, missing score/severity/completion markers, timeout, or CLI failure means `outside_status: unavailable`. Follow this caller's existing fallback/decision flow; never turn missing coverage into a clean/PASS result. After presentation or failure, delete the private prompt file you created (only that owned temporary file); the invocation already removes its own scratch directory.

Outer tool timeout: 720000ms. On any failed invocation or incomplete review, mark this phase unavailable and retain its native pass. Disabled skips the outside invocation; it retains the native pass.

For this phase (ceo), retain the historical review-log skill identifier. Add `"host":"claude","outside_provider":"codex","outside_status":"completed|unavailable|disabled|skipped","phase":"ceo"`. Record each attempted pass separately when outcomes differ. Use `source:"codex"` only for completed external CLI output, and `source:"in-host"` for a native pass. Historical `source:"claude"` continues to mean a native Claude subagent. CLI availability or a native fallback does not count as outside completion. Preserve reported modelUsage, including multiple models; unknown model identity stays unknown.

  **Error handling:** Both calls block in foreground. Codex auth/timeout/empty → proceed with
  Claude subagent only, tagged `[single-model]`. If Claude subagent also fails →
  "Outside voices unavailable — continuing with primary review."

  **Degradation matrix:** Both fail → "single-reviewer mode". Codex only →
  tag `[codex-only]`. Subagent only → tag `[subagent-only]`.

- Strategy choices: if the outside reviewer disagrees with a premise or scope decision with valid
  strategic reason → TASTE DECISION. If both models agree the user's stated structure
  should change (merge, split, add, remove) → USER CHALLENGE (never auto-decided).

**Required execution checklist (CEO):**

Step 0 (0A-0F) — run each sub-step and produce:
- 0A: Premise challenge with specific premises named and evaluated
- 0B: Existing code leverage map (sub-problems → existing code)
- 0C: Dream state diagram (CURRENT → THIS PLAN → 12-MONTH IDEAL)
- 0C-bis: Implementation alternatives table (2-3 approaches with effort/risk/pros/cons)
- 0D: Mode-specific analysis with scope decisions logged
- 0E: Temporal interrogation (HOUR 1 → HOUR 6+)
- 0F: Mode selection confirmation

Step 0.5 (Dual Voices): Present the completed calls above under Codex SAYS
(CEO — strategy challenge) and Claude SUBAGENT (CEO — strategic independence).
Produce CEO consensus table:

```
CEO DUAL VOICES — CONSENSUS TABLE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Dimension                           Claude  Codex  Consensus
  ──────────────────────────────────── ─────── ─────── ─────────
  1. Premises valid?                   —       —      —
  2. Right problem to solve?           —       —      —
  3. Scope calibration correct?        —       —      —
  4. Alternatives sufficiently explored?—      —      —
  5. Competitive/market risks covered? —       —      —
  6. 6-month trajectory sound?         —       —      —
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONFIRMED = both agree. DISAGREE = models differ (→ taste decision).
Missing voice = N/A (not CONFIRMED). Single critical finding from one voice = flagged regardless.
```

Sections 1-10 — for EACH section, run the evaluation criteria from the loaded skill file:
- Sections WITH findings: full analysis, auto-decide each issue, log to audit trail
- Sections with NO findings: 1-2 sentences stating what was examined and why nothing
  was flagged. NEVER compress a section to just its name in a table row.
- Section 11 (Design): run only if UI scope was detected in Phase 0

**Mandatory outputs from Phase 1:**
- "NOT in scope" section with deferred items and rationale
- "What already exists" section mapping sub-problems to existing code
- Error & Rescue Registry table (from Section 2)
- Failure Modes Registry table (from review sections)
- Dream state delta (where this plan leaves us vs 12-month ideal)
- Completion Summary (the full summary table from the CEO skill)

**Close this phase before continuing:** Apply accepted decisions to `Implementation plan`;
Read back against decisions. Mark taste pending final approval; preserve original
direction for unresolved User Challenges. Check successful Write/Edit results for
all outputs and both reviewers' terminal status (unavailable/disabled allowed).
Only then emit this actual assistant message:

**Phase 1 complete.**
Codex: [completed: N concerns / unavailable / disabled]. Claude subagent: [completed: N issues / unavailable].
Consensus: [X/6 confirmed, Y disagreements → surfaced at gate].
Passing to Phase 2.

Do NOT begin Phase 2 until all Phase 1 outputs are written to the plan file,
including the premise assessment (queued premise challenges travel to the
Final Gate — they never pause the pipeline here).
