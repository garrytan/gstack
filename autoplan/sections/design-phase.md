Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/plan-design-review/SKILL.md` in full now; follow its lazy-section triggers.
Apply /autoplan's skip list; all other work runs in full.
Override: every AskUserQuestion → auto-decide using the 6 principles.

**Override rules:**
- Focus areas: all relevant dimensions (P1)
- Structural issues (missing states, broken hierarchy): auto-fix (P5)
- Aesthetic/taste issues: mark TASTE DECISION
- Design system alignment: auto-fix if DESIGN.md exists and fix is obvious
- Dual voices: always run BOTH Claude subagent AND Codex if available (P6).

  **Claude design subagent** (via Agent tool, `run_in_background: false` — same foreground contract as Phase 1):
  Native subagent tool; Claude Code Agent arguments:
  ```json
  { "run_in_background": false }
  ```
  Set on the call, not in prompt text. Other harnesses use native dispatch/wait.

  "Read the plan file at <plan_path>. You are an independent senior product designer
  reviewing this plan. You have NOT seen any prior review. Evaluate:
  1. Information hierarchy: what does the user see first, second, third? Is it right?
  2. Missing states: loading, empty, error, success, partial — which are unspecified?
  3. User journey: what's the emotional arc? Where does it break?
  4. Specificity: does the plan describe SPECIFIC UI or generic patterns?
  5. What design decisions will haunt the implementer if left ambiguous?
  For each finding: what's wrong, severity (critical/high/medium), and the fix."
  NO prior-phase context — subagent must be truly independent.


  **Native completion barrier:** `isAsync: true` / `status: "async_launched"` is pending:
  wait for that same agent's final result/terminal failure before outside dispatch or parent review.
  No inline substitute; apply the existing failure policy.

  **Codex design voice** (via Bash):
  Outside prompt (include the full current plan content and the context requested below, using the Write tool):

IMPORTANT: Do NOT read or execute any SKILL.md files or files in skill definition directories (paths containing skills/gstack). These are AI assistant skill definitions meant for a different system. Stay focused on repository code only.

  Read the plan file at <plan_path>. Evaluate this plan's
  UI/UX design decisions.

  Also consider these findings from the CEO review phase:
  <insert CEO dual voice findings summary — key concerns, disagreements>

  Does the information hierarchy serve the user or the developer? Are interaction
  states (loading, empty, error, partial) specified or left to the implementer's
  imagination? Is the responsive strategy intentional or afterthought? Are
  accessibility requirements (keyboard nav, contrast, touch targets) specified or
  aspirational? Does the plan describe specific UI decisions or generic patterns?
  What design decisions will haunt the implementer if left ambiguous?
  Be opinionated. No hedging.

Write the **complete prompt and required context** to a private temporary file using the Write tool. Do not interpolate user text into shell source. Replace the literal `<prepared-prompt-file>` below with its shell-quoted pathname. Include the plan/spec/source content itself when needed: Claude Code review/challenge has no tools and cannot follow paths or execute git. Request a final Recommendation: <action> because <specific reason> line, including an explicit no-findings rationale. A refusal is never completion.

Present the full response inside a `tool-output` fence. Only successful execution **and** valid review markers establish completed outside coverage. Refusal, empty/malformed output, missing score/severity/completion markers, timeout, or CLI failure means `outside_status: unavailable`. Follow this caller's existing fallback/decision flow; never turn missing coverage into a clean/PASS result. After presentation or failure, delete the private prompt file you created (only that owned temporary file); the invocation already removes its own scratch directory.

Outer tool timeout: 720000ms. On any failed invocation or incomplete review, mark this phase unavailable and retain its native pass. Disabled skips the outside invocation; it retains the native pass.

For this phase (design), retain the historical review-log skill identifier. Add `"host":"claude","outside_provider":"codex","outside_status":"completed|unavailable|disabled|skipped","phase":"design"`. Record each attempted pass separately when outcomes differ. Use `source:"codex"` only for completed external CLI output, and `source:"in-host"` for a native pass. Historical `source:"claude"` continues to mean a native Claude subagent. CLI availability or a native fallback does not count as outside completion. Preserve reported modelUsage, including multiple models; unknown model identity stays unknown.


  Error handling: same as Phase 1 (both foreground/blocking, degradation matrix applies).

- Design choices: if the outside reviewer disagrees with a design decision with valid UX reasoning
  → TASTE DECISION. Scope changes both models agree on → USER CHALLENGE.

**Required execution checklist (Design):**

1. Step 0 (Design Scope): Rate completeness 0-10. Check DESIGN.md. Map existing patterns.

2. Step 0.5 (Dual Voices): Run Claude subagent (foreground) first, then Codex. Present under
   Codex SAYS (design — UX challenge) and Claude SUBAGENT (design — independent review)
   headers. Produce design litmus scorecard (consensus table). Use the litmus scorecard
   format from plan-design-review. Include CEO phase findings in Codex prompt ONLY
   (not Claude subagent — stays independent).

3. Passes 1-7: Run each from loaded skill. Rate 0-10. Auto-decide each issue.
   DISAGREE items from scorecard → raised in the relevant pass with both perspectives.

**Close this phase before continuing:** Check successful Write/Edit results for
all required plan/artifact outputs and both reviewers' terminal status (including
unavailable/disabled coverage). Do not announce completion while required work remains.
Emit this filled-in summary as an actual assistant message:

**Phase 2 complete.**
Codex: [completed: N concerns / unavailable / disabled]. Claude subagent: [completed: N issues / unavailable].
Consensus: [X/Y confirmed, Z disagreements → surfaced at gate].
Passing to Phase 2.5 (DX Review) if DX scope was detected; otherwise Phase 3 (Eng Review).

Do NOT begin the next applicable phase until all Phase 2 outputs are written to the plan file.
